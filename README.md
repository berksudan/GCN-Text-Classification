# Text Categorization Using GCN
Inzva AI Projects #4, Text Categorization Using GCN


## Build
It is applicable for only Linux distros. You can update the commands and use the equivalent ones in other distros (Mac, Windows, etc.)

Executing ```buid.sh``` will create a new _virtual environment_ in the project folder and install dependencies into that. Run the following command to build: 
```console
bash build.sh
```

Be sure that your computer is connected to internet. I can take a while to download dependendencies.
