Apparent response of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis to intrathecal interferon alpha.
 An 8-year-old boy with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) was treated with 1.0 to 3.0 x 10(6) IU human interferon alpha (IFN) by the intrathecal route weekly or fortnightly.
 Pronounced improvement of clinical and electroencephalographic findings were observed in a dose-dependent manner.
 Our patient raises hope that IFN can induce sustained remission in patients with SSPE.
