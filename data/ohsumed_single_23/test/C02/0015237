Voluntary human immunodeficiency virus testing: acceptance levels and identification of seropositive individuals.
 Of 4340 clients of a clinic for those with sexually transmitted diseases who were eligible for voluntary, confidential, serologic testing for the human immunodeficiency virus, 4246 (97.8%) consented to testing; 23 (0.5%) were seropositive.
 Of 94 persons who declined voluntary testing but who were tested in a blinded study, nine (9.6%) were seropositive.
 Seropositive persons who declined voluntary testing did not conceal their association with a risk group, while only 61% of seropositive individuals who accepted voluntary testing admitted to inclusion in a risk group before the test.
 Voluntary testing appears to be insufficient, because 28% of the seropositive individuals were not identified as being seropositive; also, there was a significant deficiency associated with identification of risk at pretest counseling among persons agreeing to voluntary testing.
