Preparation and characterization of an intravenous solution of IgG from human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive donors.
 An intravenous solution of 99% pure globulin (hyperimmune IgG, HIVIG) was obtained from pooled plasma of selected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-seropositive asymptomatic donors with greater than 400 CD4+/microliters cells per microliter and a high titer of antibody to HIV-1 p24 protein.
 HIVIG had high titers of antibody to p24, glycoprotein 41 (gp41), and gp120, group-specific neutralizing activity, and binding to the gp120 hypervariable loop region.
 It inhibited syncytia formation.
 At low concentration, it enhanced viral production of HIV-1 in infected peripheral blood monocytes but was inhibitory at higher concentration.
 HIVIG directed group-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against HIV-infected targets.
 For a period of 6 to 28 months, plasma donors kept stable antibody titers and had a 1.0% decrease in CD4+ cells per month.
 One gram per kilogram HIVIG injected in two juvenile chimpanzees was well tolerated and did not transmit HIV, as measured by negative cell culture, IgM immune response to HIV proteins, and polymerase chain reaction.
 The mean half-life of HIV-1 p24 antibody was 15 days.
 These preliminary data suggest that HIVIG is a safe product suitable for clinical trial in HIV-1-infected individuals.
