Antibodies to HIV-1 nef(p27): prevalence, significance, and relationship to seroconversion.
 A sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunoassay for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nef gene product, p27, has been developed using recombinant Escherichia coli-derived protein from the LAV-1-Bru sequence.
 Of 92 HIV-1 infected hemophiliacs, 72 (78%) produced anti-nef antibodies in this assay; the early appearance of anti-nef prior to full seroconversion was a rare event in this population, occurring in only one subject (approximately 1%).
 Anti-nef antibodies were not detected in any of 500 sera from 98 repeatedly HIV seronegative subjects who had been exposed to sexually transmitted modes of HIV infection (45 subjects) or through blood products (53 subjects).
 There was no significant association of titer or anti-nef antibody with protection from disease in HIV infection (p = 0.1).
 Although the nef protein is relatively immunogenic in natural infection, this study cannot confirm the previously reported high prevalence of anti-nef antibodies prior to seroconversion, nor the finding of anti-nef antibodies in HIV seronegative but exposed subjects.
