A report of eight HIV-seropositive patients with major depression responding to fluoxetine.
 This pilot study examined the effectiveness of fluoxetine in depressed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive asymptomatic patients.
 Eight patients, participating in an AZT trial who met criteria for major depression syndrome (DSM-III-R), were treated with fluoxetine (20 or 40 mg/day) for 4 weeks.
 Initially, mean Hamilton Depression scores were 23.8 (range of 17-31), and improved to 6.4 (range of 3-10).
 All subjects maintained their remission over a 2-month follow-up.
 Fluoxetine treatment may be effective in treating major depression in HIV-seropositive asymptomatic patients.
