Biologic effects of interferons.
 If one were to review articles on IFN published between 1957 and 1967 it would become apparent that virtually none of the tenets held then are still valid today.
 Whereas IFN was long considered to be a specific antiviral substance without any effect on normal cellular metabolism, we accept today that it affects normal cell division and many specialized cellular functions.
 In this respect it is not unique; IFN is a prototype of a family of similar substances now called cytokines that all appear to function as regulatory molecules.
 It was held that the production of IFN constituted a specific response to a viral infection.
 Today we believe that IFN is an integral part of a cytokine network and that they and other cytokines may be produced constitutively at low levels.
 These substances exert multiple effects on virtually all cells.
 They play an important role in host defense against viral and parasitic infections, and in the resistance to experimental tumors.
 IFN can be shown to exert effects on the immune system and on lymphocyte circulation.
 Lastly, because of the multiplicity of their biologic effects, they may even contribute to the pathogenesis of certain diseases.
 Thus, when large amounts of IFN are administered or induced in newborn mice they can cause liver, kidney, and pulmonary disease.
 The field of IFN and cytokine research continues to expand and there is an increasing number of therapeutic applications.
 Twenty years from now, scientists and clinicians may be surprised that we understood so little of how IFN act and how inadequately we used them to treat disease.
