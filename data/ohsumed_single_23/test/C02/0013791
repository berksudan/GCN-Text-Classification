The effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 The murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) is associated with proliferation of target cells that have been infected by a defective retrovirus.
 To control the growth of this primary neoplasia, virus-inoculated mice were treated with anti-neoplastic drugs.
 Paradoxically, cyclophosphamide, which is also immunosuppressive, was very effective in preventing the appearance and progression of the disease, in restoring a normal T cell function, and in depleting the number of infected target cells.
 This result suggests that the proliferating infected target cells were responsible for the immunodeficiency.
