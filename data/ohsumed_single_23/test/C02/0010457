Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against HIV-coated target cells by peripheral blood monocytes from HIV seropositive asymptomatic patients.
 Cytotoxic effector cells like cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils can lyse directly HIV-infected or HIV-coated cells in the absence or presence of anti-HIV antibodies.
 Therefore, these cytotoxic mechanisms can be invoked either in the control of HIV infection at early stages of the disease or in the generalized immunosuppression observed at later stages of the disease.
 The relationship between anti-HIV effector mechanisms and disease, however, remains elusive.
 The present study investigates in HIV+ seropositive asymptomatic patients peripheral blood monocytes (PBM)-mediated antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HIV-coated target cells in the presence of heterologous or autologous anti-HIV serum.
 To test for specific ADCC against HIV Ag, a T4+ CEM.TR line resistant to TNF and macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity was selected in vitro.
 ADCC was performed in an 18-h 51Cr-release assay using CEM.TR cells coated with inactivated HIV.
 Unlike PBM from normal controls, significant ADCC was observed by PBM from HIV+ seropositive patients in the presence of pooled HIV+ antiserum.
 The ADCC activity was specific for HIV and was dependent on the E:T ratio and the antiserum dilution used.
 Upon activation of PBM with rIFN-gamma, both normal and HIV+ PBM-mediated ADCC against HIV-coated CEM.TR.
 Furthermore, ADCC activity by PBM from HIV+ seropositive patients in the presence of their autologous serum was examined.
 Significant ADCC activity was observed and was dependent on the E:T ratio and serum dilution used.
 The findings demonstrating anti-HIV ADCC activity by PBM from HIV+ seropositive individuals and their autologous sera support the notion that monocyte-mediated ADCC may be operative in vivo.
