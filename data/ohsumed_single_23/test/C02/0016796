Influence of inhaled cadmium on the immune response to influenza virus.
 Cadmium may exacerbate pulmonary infections.
 In a previous study, however, cadmium appeared to enhance mouse resistance to influenza pneumonia.
 We report herein on the influence of cadmium intoxication in mice on different factors of anti-influenza immunity, e.g., antibody response, local production of interferon, pulmonary cellular response, and the interaction between pulmonary alveolar macrophages and the influenza virus.
 Cadmium inhalation did not affect production of antibodies or interferon.
 The protective effect appeared to be related to an enhanced supply to phagocytic cells into the lung.
