Exchange transfusion as an adjunct to the treatment of severe falciparum malaria: case report and review.
 Malaria associated with complications or a fatal outcome is almost always caused by Plasmodium falciparum.
 The mortality due to this disease parallels the degree of parasitemia.
 Successful use of exchange blood transfusion as a therapeutic adjunct for this infection was first reported in 1974, although the efficacy of this procedure has not been established by randomized, controlled trials.
 The rationale for this form of therapy is based on: (1) rapid reduction in the parasite load by direct removal; (2) decreased risk of severe intravascular hemolysis and its consequences (disseminated intravascular coagulation and renal dysfunction); (3) improved rheology with transfused blood and reduced microcirculatory sludging; and (4) improved oxygen-carrying capacity with transfused erythrocytes.
 We describe a case of severe falciparum malaria and review the literature describing the use of exchange transfusion for treatment of this infection.
