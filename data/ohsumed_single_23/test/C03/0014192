Scabies in nursing homes: an eradication program with permethrin 5% cream.
 Permethrin 5% cream was used to treat scabies in three large nursing homes under a compassionate-plea protocol for chronic, therapy-resistant infestations.
 All residents, staff, and frequent visitors were treated whether or not symptomatic.
 Family members of these groups were treated either when symptomatic or directly exposed to scabies.
 Nine hundred ninety-five persons were treated, 202 of whom were diagnosed with scabies.
 Approximately 35% (111 of 313) of nursing home residents were diagnosed with scabies.
 These were patients in whom multiple treatments with other scabicides were unsuccessful.
 At the completion of the study, 195 patients were examined for efficacy of treatment.
 Of these, 91 (46.7%) had clearing of lesions with one medication application, 77 (39.5%) with two treatments, and 23 (11.8%) with three or more treatments.
 The overall cure rate was 98%.
 Adverse experiences occurred in 2.4% of cases and were mild (i.e., pruritus and rash).
