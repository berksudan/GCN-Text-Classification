Acanthamoeba keratitis with two species of Acanthamoeba.
 We describe a case of Acanthamoeba keratitis related to soft contact lens wear.
 The patient presented with a 3-week history of severe uniocular pain, radial stromal infiltrates and subepithelial infiltrates with no epithelial defect.
 Acanthamoeba was cultured from the corneal biopsy specimen, contact lens and lens case.
 The corneal biopsy culture grew both A.
 castellani and A.
 polyphaga as well as Escherichia coli.
 The patient was treated with topical dibromopropamidine isethionate (Brolene) drops, neomycin and polymyxin B drops and fortified gentamicin drops.
 Gradual clinical improvement ensued.
