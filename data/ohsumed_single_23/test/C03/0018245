Rapid microscopic detection of malaria parasites permanently fluorochrome stained in blood smears with aluminum and morin.
 Intra- and extracellular Plasmodium parasites in fixed blood smears are easily identifiable by fluorescence microscopy after brief mordanting with aluminum ammonium sulfate and staining with morin (3,5,7,1',4'-pentahydroxyflavanol).
 The intensely fluorescent preparations of stained parasites are strongly resistant to photodegradation and remained essentially unimpaired for two years.
