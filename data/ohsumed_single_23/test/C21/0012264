Measurement of end-expiratory pressure during transtracheal high frequency jet ventilation for laryngoscopy 
 An anaesthetic technique using high frequency jet ventilation has been proposed for direct laryngoscopy, but this may expose the patients to the risk of barotrauma.
 In order to assess this risk, we have measured end-expiratory airway pressure (EEP) through the injector using two three-way solenoid valves mounted in series.
 At the end of insufflation the first valve was switched off and the apparatus deadspace connected to atmosphere through a large exit port during an adjustable time (decompression time).
 Then the second valve was switched off and the injection line connected to a transducer, allowing measurement of EEP through the injector.
 The accuracy of this measurement was tested against airway pressure measured directly in the trachea (Pt) in a lung model.
 Provided that the decompression time was long enough (70 ms) and the apparatus deadspace was small (6 ml), the difference between EEP and Pt was less than 1 cm H2O for frequencies up to 5 Hz.
 A clinical evaluation was performed in 64 patients under general anaesthesia before laryngoscopy.
 EEP correlated with end-expiratory pulmonary volume above apnoeic FRC inferred from abdominal and thoracic displacements.
 At jet frequencies up to 5 Hz, the correlations between these two variables were satisfactory (r greater than 0.88), suggesting that EEP is a good indicator of pulmonary overdistension.
