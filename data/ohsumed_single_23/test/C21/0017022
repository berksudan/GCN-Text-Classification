A semiinvasive method for articular Colles' fractures.
 An external fixation device that allows limited motion of the wrist joint without disruption of the anatomic alignment was used for the articular Colles' fractures in this study.
 From July 1985 to April 1989 during a 45-month period, 87 patients with 90 articular Colles' fractures (three cases with bilateral involvement) were treated with a modified dynamic external skeletal device after a closed reduction in full supination of the forearm.
 Excellent anatomic reduction near 91% of the sound wrist as well as satisfactory functional results around 90.5% of the sound wrist were gained during the 24-month follow-up period.
 Forearm muscles exert compression forces on distal radial metaphyseal fractures throughout the healing period.
 Any procedure or device that cannot provide constant counterforce to the action of forearm muscles during fracture healing will result in the loss of anatomic reduction.
 Adequate distraction counter-force was provided by an external fixation device that was superior to other conventional methods because of its simple application, low rate of complications, and excellent anatomic and functional results.
