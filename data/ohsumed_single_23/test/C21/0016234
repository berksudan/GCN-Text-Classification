A landmark case in asbestosis.
 The first published account of disease attributed to occupational asbestos exposure was that of Nellie Kershaw, who died in 1924.
 The circumstances relating to that case are described and explanations are given for its not having a greater impact on policy at that time.
 This case, starting in 1898, is set in the context of missed opportunities for preventing a major public health hazard.
 The effects of this hazard are still being witnessed today.
