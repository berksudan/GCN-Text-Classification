Bone stimulators for fusions and fractures.
 Even though a complete understanding of electrical responses of bone has not been fully obtained, useful data toward this end have been gathered.
 The development of devices that use what is known about the bone's electrophysiologic properties has impacted patient care.
 Many health care professionals remain skeptical about the effects of electrical stimulation in bone healing.
 Therefore, further research is needed to help the practitioner formulate a more educated opinion on this form of therapy.
