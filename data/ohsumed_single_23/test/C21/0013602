Recent trends in the development of alcohol and drug treatment services in Ontario.
 This article summarizes the major trends in the development of alcohol and drug treatment services in Ontario since 1979.
 These trends are contrasted to the objectives of a province-wide Addiction Research Foundation (ARF) community development program designed to establish or expand addiction services within this same time period.
 Data were obtained from all treatment services in the province by surveys undertaken in 1980, 1983 and 1986.
 Across the period of analysis, there have been rapid increases in the number of addiction programs, their total cost and the total treatment caseload.
 Some specific changes have been quite consistent with ARF objectives: a stabilization in the use of hospital beds for addictions treatment, an increase in community-based versus hospital-based treatment resources, an increase in the province-wide capacity for comprehensive client assessment and a larger representation of women in addictions programs.
 Other ARF objectives have yet to be achieved.
 In particular, a major increase in nonresidential treatment alternatives and an increase in the proportion of treated cases from special populations such as youth or the elderly are still required.
 Suggestions are made concerning future program development.
