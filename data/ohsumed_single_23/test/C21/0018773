Analysis of the soft-tissue response to components used in the manufacture of breast implants: rat animal model.
 The implant-tissue response to the silicone gel mammary prosthesis requires a more thorough evaluation in light of recent concerns related to human connective-tissue diseases, contracture, infection, and neoplasia.
 The silicone prosthesis is not a homogeneous implant but is a milieu of various silicone chemistries.
 Silicone polymer precursors and prosthesis components (silicone shells, shells extracted of their low-molecular-weight components, silica-free silicone, silicone oil, fumed silica, and silicone extract) were implanted subcutaneously using a nonhemorrhagic technique into the backs of Lew/SsN rats (n = 90), two implants per rat, for periods of 7, 14, 28, 56, and 90 days for a total of 6 implants per material per time period.
 Histologic analysis was performed on specimens from the harvested soft tissue.
 The intensity of the cellular and capsular response was lowest for the silicone oil and increased as the material's molecular weight increased and material compliance decreased.
 Fumed silica elicited the most highly reactive cellular response.
 From this study it is apparent that the polymer's molecular weight influences its migration, encapsulation, and intensity of cellular response.
 Further, the silicone extract distillate elicited a highly intense cellular response with pronounced lymphocyte invasion.
 The human relevance of this work awaits further correlation with implant retrieval and in vivo performance.
