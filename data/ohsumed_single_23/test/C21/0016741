Transdermal nicotine and smoking behavior in psychiatric patients.
 The authors used a double-blind crossover design to observe the effect of transdermally administered nicotine on the smoking behavior of 13 psychiatric patients who were not trying to stop smoking.
 The patients smoked significantly fewer cigarettes while receiving nicotine than while receiving placebo.
 These data suggest that transdermally administered nicotine can be a useful adjunct in treating nicotine-addicted psychiatric patients in a non-smoking environment.
