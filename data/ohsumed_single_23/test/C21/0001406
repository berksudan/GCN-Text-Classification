Oxygen delivery and consumption in head-injured and multiple trauma patients.
 Critically ill patients often demonstrate that whole body oxygen consumption (VO2) is dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2).
 In this retrospective study, the relationship of VO2 to DO2 in patients with isolated head injury (HI, n = 18) was compared to that in patients with multiple trauma (MT, n = 60) without serious head injury.
 Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, arterial PCO2, cardiac index, and oxygen delivery were significantly lower in HI, but oxygen consumption was not different in the groups.
 In both groups, changes in DO2 (delta DO2) within each patient were significantly correlated with changes in VO2 (delta VO2) in that same patient.
 This relationship was not different between the HI patients, (delta VO2 = (0.20 +/- 0.02) delta DO2), and the MT patients (delta VO2 = (0.17 +/- 0.01) delta DO2).
 When these groups were further divided into those with high hematocrit (greater than 32%) and low hematocrit (less than 32%), HI patients with a low hematocrit demonstrated a steeper regression slope, with 26 +/- 3% of the DO2 change being reflected in the VO2 change.
 This was significantly greater than the slope in HI patients with high hematocrit (13 +/- 3%) and the MT patients at high (19 +/- 2%) or low (16 +/- 2%) hematocrits.
 These data show a correlation between changes in oxygen delivery and consumption that is similar in both head-injury patients and multiple trauma patients without serious head injury.
 This relationship was greatest in head-injured patients at low hematocrit.
 This relationship of VO2 and DO2 in both groups suggests an influence of neurohumoral factors rather than local tissue phenomena.
