Diving-related inner ear injuries.
 Diving-related inner ear barotrauma (IEB) and inner ear decompression sickness (IEDS) most often result in permanent severe cochleovestibular deficits, unless immediate diagnosis is reached and the correct treatment is commenced early.
 Nine cases of sport-diving-induced inner ear injuries that were referred to the Israeli Naval Hyperbaric Institute between October 1987 and September 1989 are presented with regard to evaluation, treatment, and follow-up.
 The diagnosis was IEB in five divers and IEDS in four.
 Explorative tympanotomy was carried out with remarkable results in two patients with IEB, while the remaining three were relieved by bed rest alone.
 Three of the four IEDS patients were recompressed according to the extended US Navy Table 6 with good short-term results.
 The role of complete otoneurological evaluation in the decision-making process leading to the correct diagnosis and treatment is emphasized.
