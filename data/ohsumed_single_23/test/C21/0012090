Alcohol abuse among grandsons of alcoholics: some preliminary findings.
 Drawing upon self-reports of family history for alcoholism, the present study compared the level of alcohol abuse among grandsons of alcoholic maternal and paternal grandfathers.
 Although based on a small sample of grandsons (N = 29), the results indicated a significantly higher level of alcohol abuse among maternal compared with paternal grandsons.
