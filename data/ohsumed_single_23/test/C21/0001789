Intraarticular malunions and nonunions.
 The principles of intraarticular fracture care and stable internal fixation, when applied to intra-articular nonunions and malunions, can result in the restoration of an amazing function to joints that seem almost totally doomed to either an arthrodesis or an arthroplasty.
 The high degree of success achieved in almost all cases illustrates the amazing recuperative powers of human joints once articular cartilage congruence and stability is re-established together with correction of axial deformities and the mobilization of joints.
