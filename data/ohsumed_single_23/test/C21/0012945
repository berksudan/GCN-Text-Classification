Pharmacokinetic dosing of phenobarbital in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome 
 We used a pharmacokinetically derived phenobarbital dosing protocol to treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome in patients admitted to a family medicine inpatient service.
 We describe the protocol and include two case reports documenting its efficacy.
 Although benzodiazepine agents are considered by many to be the primary agents of choice, based upon our experience and its ease of administration, relative safety, therapeutic efficacy, and lower cost, phenobarbital should be reconsidered as a promising alternative.
 Comparative trials between these two therapeutic classes will clarify their roles in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
