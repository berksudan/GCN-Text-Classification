Immediate closed reduction of cervical spine dislocations using traction.
 Cervical facet dislocations may be reduced rapidly and effectively using axial traction with weights applied at over the traditional 45-pound limit.
 Fifty-three sequential patients with cervical facet dislocations were reviewed.
 Thirty-nine patients required more than 50 pounds of traction to achieve rapid reduction.
 Sixty-eight percent of the entire series showed significant improvement in neurologic function.
 There were no cases of significant loss of function.
 A cadaver study confirmed that the cranial tongs could support over 100 pounds of traction.
 Careful application of up to 100 pounds seems to be associated with a low risk of neurologic compromise or tong failure, but results in effective reduction of dislocations.
