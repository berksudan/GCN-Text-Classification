Complications in evaluating abdominal trauma: diagnostic peritoneal lavage versus computerized axial tomography.
 We reviewed our experience with 2,809 DPL's and 1,331 CT's obtained in the resuscitative phase over a 3-year period in our trauma system to determine the significant complications associated with each modality.
 There were 25 DPL complications: eight false negatives, three false positives, and 14 technical errors.
 There were 46 CT complications including 25 false negative scans, three false positive scans, and 18 delays to the operating room from obtaining abdominal CT evaluation, with two of these delays resulting in preventable deaths.
 Although both modalities had low complication rates (0.9% DPL vs.
 3.4% CT), DPL was associated with less preventable mortality and morbidity than CT in the evaluation of abdominal trauma.
