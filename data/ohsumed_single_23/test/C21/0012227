Carbidopa-levodopa overdose.
 A 57-year-old woman ingested 15 to 17 tablets of carbidopa-levodopa 10/100 tablets (carbidopa 150 mg and levodopa 1,500 mg) along with ibuprofen, carisoprodol, hydrocodone, and acetaminophen.
 The patient developed choreiform movements that persisted despite obtundation and attempts to extinguish them with naloxone, morphine, and diazepam.
 When the patient developed a rising level of creatine phosphokinase and myoglobinuria, she was treated with ventilatory support and pancuronium.
 She required paralysis for 60 hours, when her chorea resolved.
