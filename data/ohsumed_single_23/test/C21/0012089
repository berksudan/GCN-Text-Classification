Subject selection bias in alcoholics volunteering for a treatment study.
 Baseline differences in alcoholism problem severity were compared between alcoholics who did and did not volunteer to participate in a treatment effectiveness study.
 A positive relationship was found between self-reports of alcohol-related problems and the degree of research participation.
 Group differences were also revealed in the rate of treatment completion.
 Possible explanations and solutions for this volunteer bias are discussed.
