Effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in burn patients.
 We studied the effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in burn patients.
 Serial measurements of granulocyte oxidative function were obtained in treated patients and in a group of controls matched for age and total burn size.
 The administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor resulted in a 50% increase in mean leukocyte counts.
 Both groups showed significant baseline increases in granulocytic cytosolic oxidative function.
 Treated patients showed normal stimulated cytosolic oxidative function, which was significantly depressed compared with that of untreated patients.
 Myeloperoxidase activity was increased in treated patients during the first postburn week but then declined to normal levels.
 Untreated patients had a significant increase in myeloperoxidase activity for the first 3 weeks following injury.
 Untreated patients exhibited a significant decrease in superoxide activity during the second 3 weeks following injury.
 Treated patients demonstrated normal superoxide activity.
