Prefabrication of composite free flaps through staged microvascular transfer: an experimental and clinical study.
 The feasibility of prefabricating free flaps by inducing, through the process of staged reconstruction, an arteriovenous bundle and its surrounding fascia to perfuse a selected block of tissue was investigated experimentally and clinically.
 Sixteen rat knee joints were wrapped with their ipsilateral superficial inferior epigastric (SIE) fascia.
 In 8 joints, the composite flaps were resected en bloc and were immediately replaced orthotopically pedicled upon the superficial inferior epigastric vessels.
 In the remaining joints, the resection and orthotopic transfer were performed 2 weeks later.
 Only the joints in the latter group, which benefited from the staging period, were found to be perfused.
 The long finger proximal interphalangeal joint of a child was reconstructed by the staged microvascular transfer of his second toe proximal interphalangeal joint.
 At the first stage, a temporalis fascia flap was wrapped around the toe proximal interphalangeal joint and revascularized to the dorsalis pedis vessels.
 Six weeks later, the joint and its temporalis fascia envelope were dissected, and the "prefabricated" joint flap was transferred to the hand and revascularized to the wrist vessels.
 Bony union progressed uneventfully with excellent recovery of the range of motion.
 We conclude that regardless of the indigenous vascular anatomy, an unlimited array of composite free flaps can be constructed and transferred based on induced large vascular pedicles.
