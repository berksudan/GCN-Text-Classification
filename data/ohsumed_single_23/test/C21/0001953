A trilaminar skin coverage technique for treatment of severe degloving injuries of the extremities and torso.
 A 60 percent degloving injury involving the torso and lower extremities of an 8-year-old boy is described.
 Successful management employed the use of a new trilaminar skin coverage technique.
 With the avulsed flap still attached to its bed, a 0.14-inch split-thickness graft of epithelium and superficial dermis is raised with a power-driven dermatome.
 From the same harvest site, one level deeper, a second layer consisting of split-thickness dermis (0.14 inch) is taken.
 Both the first and second layers are meshed and expanded.
 The remaining degloved flap is excised and, on a sterile bench, defatted to produce a third layer of deep dermis.
 In our case, this third layer was ultimately lost, but it functioned well as a temporary biologic dressing.
 Depending on donor-site morbidity, other potential applications of this method (i.e., major burn injuries) may be feasible.
