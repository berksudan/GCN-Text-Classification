Accuracy of diagnoses from magnetic resonance imaging of the knee. A multi-center analysis of one thousand and fourteen patients.
 Magnetic resonance images of the knee were made for 1014 patients, and the diagnosis was subsequently confirmed arthroscopically.
 The accuracy of the diagnoses from the imaging was 89 per cent for the medial meniscus, 88 per cent for the lateral meniscus, 93 per cent for the anterior cruciate ligament, and 99 per cent for the posterior cruciate ligament.
 The magnetic resonance examinations were done at several centers, and the results varied substantially among centers.
 The accuracy ranged from 64 to 95 per cent for the medial meniscus, from 83 to 94 per cent for the lateral meniscus, and from 78 to 97 per cent for the anterior cruciate ligament.
 The results from different magnetic-resonance units were also compared, and the findings suggested increased accuracy for the units that had a stronger magnetic field.
 Of the menisci for which the magnetic resonance signal was reported to be Grade II (a linear intrameniscal signal not extending to the superior or inferior meniscal surface), 17 per cent were found to be torn at arthroscopy.
