Fat distribution and steroid hormones in women with alcohol abuse.
 Anthropometric, hormonal and liver function parameters were examined in 18 premenopausal women with a history of early alcohol abuse, and compared with the data for randomly selected controls of the same age.
 The alcoholic women showed slightly elevated levels of transaminases, but no clinical or laboratory signs of advanced liver damage.
 These women were characterized by an increased waist-to-hip ratio, due to enlarged waist circumference.
 Several endocrine abnormalities were found, including irregular or absent menses as well as low oestrogen, progesterone and delta-4-androstendione levels.
 The concentration of free testosterone was high and that of sex-hormone-binding globulin was low.
 These data suggest abdominal distribution of body fat, as well as hyperandrogenicity in alcoholic, premenopausal women.
 It is postulated that the endocrine abnormalities might be responsible for the abdominal fat distribution.
