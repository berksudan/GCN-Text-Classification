Surgical treatment of brachial plexus birth palsy.
 Brachial plexus birth palsy remains a challenging condition.
 In the 1000 infants followed from 1977 to 1988, functional results were much improved over those obtained by observation only, if surgical exploration and repair were performed when no clinical recuperation of biceps function occurred by three months of age.
 Recovery is slow, and comprehensive follow-up study of reconstructed and conservatively managed children is required to prevent joint contractures.
 Children who will benefit from palliative procedures such as tendon transfers must also be identified.
