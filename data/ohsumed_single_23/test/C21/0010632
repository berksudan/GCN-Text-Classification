Management of close-range shotgun injuries to the chest by diaphragmatic transposition: case reports.
 A method of reconstructing the chest wall following close-range shotgun injuries is described.
 This technique requires detaching the diaphragm peripherally and suturing it above the chest wall defect, resulting in an intact chest cavity and an abdominal wall defect.
 This latter problem can then be addressed by a variety of standard methods.
 Two patients are presented with excellent long-term results of diaphragmatic transposition, which should be in the armamentarium of all surgeons who deal with trunk trauma.
