Nail-gun suicide.
 Two cases are reported of young men who committed suicide using a nail gun.
 One shot himself through the heart and left lung.
 The other shot himself in the head.
 No cases of completed suicide by nail gun have previously been reported in the English literature.
 These cases are reported because of their uncommon nature and because they represent a potentially fatal use of a relatively common industrial implement.
