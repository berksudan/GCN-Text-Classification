Fracture of the index metacarpal base with subluxation of the trapeziometacarpal joint. A case report.
 A 40-year-old man fell on his outstretched arm and suffered a fracture of the index metacarpal base with subluxation of the thumb basal joint.
 The small fracture fragment at the base of the index metacarpal was attached to the base of the thumb metacarpal by a strong ligament, as noted at the time of surgery.
 This pattern of injury, a ligament-reversed Bennett's fracture, seems not to have been previously reported.
