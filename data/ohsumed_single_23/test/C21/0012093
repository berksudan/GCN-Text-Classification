Comparison of the Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test (SAAST) and the Khavari Alcohol Test (KAT): results from an alcoholic population and their collaterals.
 This study examined the reports of patients and their collaterals on drinking practices, as measured by the summary scale of the Khavari Alcohol Test (the annual absolute alcohol intake, AAAI) and alcohol related behavioral patterns, as assessed by the Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test (SAAST).
 In- and outpatients from two Milwaukee area substance abuse treatment hospitals, and a number of their collaterals, participated in this study.
 Patients' and collaterals' responses on the AAAI and the SAAST were compared through the use of a paired t test.
 Results indicated no significant differences between patients' self-reports compared with collateral reports, and demonstrated a direct relationship on the AAAI (two tailed p less than 0.001) and SAAST (two-tailed p less than 0.001).
 Self-reports of patients who volunteered collaterals compared with self-reports of patients who did not volunteer collaterals also showed no significant differences on the AAAI or the SAAST, demonstrating consistency of reporting whether the patients believed their reports would be compared with information provided by a collateral or not.
 The AAAI and the SAAST corroborated in their diagnoses of patients as suffering from alcoholism (r = 0.515, p less than 0.001).
 Multivariate analysis revealed no significant effect of demographic variables on either the AAAI or the SAAST.
 This study shows: (a) impressive concordance between patient and collateral reports; (2) apparent intactness of memory, and little evidence of denial, as measured by the instruments; and (3) the efficacy of measures such as the AAAI and the SAAST, two vastly different scales measuring dimensions of alcoholism.
