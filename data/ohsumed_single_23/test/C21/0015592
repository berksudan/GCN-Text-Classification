Bell ringers' bruises and broken bones: capers and crises in campanology 
 OBJECTIVE--To determine the incidence, aeriology, and outcome of injuries due to bell ringing.
 DESIGN--Retrospective review of the last six years' issues of Ringing World, advertisement in Ringing World, and a postal questionnaire sent to 20 active ringing towers.
 SUBJECTS--Regular bell ringers.
 RESULTS--Seventy nine injuries were identified both from review and by advertisement in Ringing World.
 The incidence of injury among 221 ringers identified by postal questionnaire was 1.8% a year.
 CONCLUSION--Although sonerous, bell ringing can be dangerous and occasionally even fatal.
 Doctors should be aware of the dangers to which campanologists expose themselves.
