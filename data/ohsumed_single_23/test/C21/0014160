Intrapulmonary distribution of bronchial blood flow after moderate smoke inhalation.
 The systemic blood flow to the airways of the left lung was determined by the radioactive microsphere technique before and 17 h after smoke inhalation in six conscious sheep (smoke group) and six sheep insufflated with air alone (sham group).
 Smoke inhalation caused a sixfold increase in systemic blood flow to the lower trachea (baseline 10.6 +/- 1.7 vs.
 injury 60.9 +/- 16.1 ml.min-1.100 g-1) and an 11- to 14-fold increase to the intrapulmonary central airways (baseline range 9.5 +/- 1.9 to 13.5 +/- 3.7 ml.min-1.100 g-1 vs.
 injury 104.6 +/- 32.2 to 187.3 +/- 83.6 ml.min-1.100 g-1).
 There was a trend for this hyperemic response to be greater as airway diameter decreased from the trachea to 2-mm-diam central airways.
 In airways smaller than 2 mm, the hyperemic response appeared to diminish.
 The total systemic blood flow to whole lung is predominantly to small peripheral airways and showed no significant increase from its baseline level of 17.5 +/- 3.7 ml.min-1.100 g-1 in the lung homogenate.
 Occlusion of the bronchoesophageal artery decreased central airway blood flow 60-80% and peripheral airway blood flow 40-60% in both the sham and the smoke groups.
