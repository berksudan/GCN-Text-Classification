The surgical treatment of severe comminuted intraarticular fractures of the distal radius with the small AO external fixation device. A prospective three-and-one-half-year follow-up study.
 Although fractures of the distal radius are very common, an optimal treatment has not been clearly delineated.
 This is a prospective study of 40 patients, mainly young and active adults, with comminuted and unstable intraarticular fractures of the distal radius.
 The end results of closed reduction and rigid fixation with the small AO external fixator includes 36 patients (90%) with excellent and good results.
 Roentgenograms of 33 of these patients showed accurate alignment of the healed fractures.
 Four patients (10%) had a fair functional result, with a partial restriction of the range of movement, although roentgenograms demonstrated good alignment of the healed fractures.
 The small AO external fixator is both a useful and convenient method for the reconstruction and treatment of comminuted intraarticular fractures of the distal radius.
