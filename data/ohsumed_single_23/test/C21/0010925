Hangman's fracture in a 7-week-old infant.
 The "hangman's fracture" in infancy and childhood is a bilateral avulsion of the pedicles or their synchondroses from the C-2 vertebral body, frequently with anterior dislocation of C-2 or C-3.
 We present the case of the youngest infant in the medical literature with a hangman's fracture and discuss anatomy, kinematics of injury, radiographic diagnosis, and treatment.
