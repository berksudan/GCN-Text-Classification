Island flap supplied by the dorsal branch of the ulnar artery.
 Two cases are reported in which a fasciocutaneous island flap was employed supplied by the ulnaris dorsalis artery after the method proposed by Becker and Gilbert.
 The original technique has been modified by the authors, and this produces a better venous outflow.
 The vascular pedicle includes, besides the ascending branch of the artery and the venae comitantes, one of the superficial veins together with its respective subdermal band.
 A technique is also described that provides an optimal length for the vascular pedicle.
