Bullet fragment venous embolus to the heart: case report.
 This report describes a case of bullet fragment embolus to the heart following a small-caliber gunshot wound to the mouth.
 Skull and C-spine films appeared to account for the projectile; however, chest X-ray followed by fluoroscopy and two-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated a venous missile embolus in the right heart.
 The bullet was palpated, trapped in the right ventricle, and easily extruded.
