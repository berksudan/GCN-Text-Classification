Traumatic rupture of the interventricular septum and tricuspid valve: case report.
 Cardiac injury following blunt trauma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and is often unsuspected.
 Isolated chamber rupture and valvular injury are infrequent but recognized consequences of nonpenetrating trauma.
 This report describes a patient who developed a perimembranous ventricular septal defect and disruption of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve as a consequence of blunt trauma.
 Diagnosis and management of traumatic ventricular septal rupture are discussed.
