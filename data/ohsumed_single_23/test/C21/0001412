Reduced dependency on arteriography for penetrating extremity trauma: influence of wound location and noninvasive vascular studies.
 Indications for arteriography in penetrating extremity trauma remain controversial.
 We reviewed our clinical experience in 454 patients (514 extremities) with penetrating trauma admitted during a prior 3 1/2-year period.
 Injuries were caused by stab wounds in 60 (11.7%) extremities and by gunshot wounds in 454 (88.3%) extremities.
 Thirty-three of the 60 stab wounds (55%) required urgent exploration, and 27 underwent arteriography.
 No arteriograms were positive for unsuspected arterial injury in this group.
 Forty-two of 454 gunshot wounds (9.3%) underwent mandatory exploration; arteriograms were performed on 412 extremities.
 Forty-four arteriograms (10.7%) demonstrated evidence of unsuspected arterial injuries.
 During the last year, randomly selected extremities (n = 23) have been studied with B-mode ultrasonography and segmental Doppler pressure measurements.
 Using the subsequent arteriography as the "gold" standard, sensitivity was 83% and specificity was 100%.
 Gunshot wounds were categorized according to location and positive arteriograms.
 Injuries to the lateral thigh and arm resulted in no positive arteriograms, while positive studies were observed in 11% of medial and posterior arm, 14% of antecubital fossa, 25% of forearm, 7.5% of medial and posterior thigh, 8% of popliteal fossa, and 26% of calf injuries.
 We recommend arteriography for gunshot injuries to identified high-risk areas, while clinical evaluation alone is accurate in all stab wounds to the extremities and gunshot wounds to the lateral thigh and outer arm.
 Preliminary data suggest expanded use of B-mode ultrasonography may further reduce our dependency on arteriography in these cases.
