Simultaneous bilateral forearm revascularization.
 A successful simultaneous bilateral forearm revascularization was performed on a 17-year-old boy.
 Functional recovery of both forearms was evaluated 42 months after injury.
 The patient can use both hands for the activities of daily living.
 So far, he has been employed and has no significant psychological problems.
 Temporary intraluminal silicone shunts are extremely helpful for reducing ischemic damage to the injured limb.
 The sufficient skeletal shortening of the upper limb replantation is crucially important.
 The wounds must be managed by aggressive and repeated debridement.
 Accurate primary nerve repair is essential, and the early postoperative rehabilitation is also important to achieve a satisfactory functional return.
 The functional replanted or revascularized upper extremity is superior to an amputation or prosthesis, especially in the cases of bilateral upper extremity amputation or devascularization.
