A reassessment of the peritoneal lavage leukocyte count in blunt abdominal trauma.
 Nine hundred and three patients undergoing diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) over a 6-year period were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the utility of the white blood cell (WBC) count in the lavage fluid.
 Eleven patients (1.2%) had dialysate WBC counts greater than 500/mm3, with erythrocyte counts less than 10(5)/mm3.
 Nine of these patients who were lavaged within 4 hours of injury had no intra-abdominal pathology.
 Two patients, lavaged after 4 hours, demonstrated intra-abdominal injury.
 Two hundred twenty-three patients (24.7%) had grossly clear dialysate which was not sent for laboratory analysis.
 None of these patients required laparotomy.
 We conclude that the WBC count in DPL fluid is of no diagnostic value in victims of blunt abdominal trauma who are lavaged within 4 hours of injury.
 In addition, laboratory analysis of clear dialysate is not required in these patients.
