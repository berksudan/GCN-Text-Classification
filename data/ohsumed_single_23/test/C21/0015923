Percutaneous screw fixation for fractures of the scaphoid.
 We describe a percutaneous technique for screw fixation of all types of fractures of the scaphoid.
 During a 15-year period ending in 1984, 280 cases were treated by this method; 198 of them returned for evaluation in 1986 and comprise the material for this report.
 After a mean postoperative time of 82 months, 89% of the recent fractures had united as well as 81.8% of those with delayed or nonunion and 42.8% of those with sclerotic nonunion.
