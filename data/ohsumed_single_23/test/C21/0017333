Functional outcome of pediatric trauma patients identified as 'non-salvageable survivors'.
 A retrospective study of 305 pediatric trauma patients seen over 17 months was undertaken to evaluate the functional outcome of patients categorized as "non-salvageable survivors" (NSS).
 Functional outcome was determined by Denver Developmental Screen Tests (DDST) for children less than 5 years of age and Rappaport Severity Rating Scale (RDRS) for those 5 years old and older.
 Each patient was assigned Abbreviated Injury Scores (AIS).
 Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and Trauma Score (TS).
 The total number of patients classified as severe was 65 (21%), and 13 were classified as non-salvageable, with seven non-salvageable survivors and six non-preventable deaths.
 Our study suggests that current trauma scoring systems tend to overestimate the non-salvageable population.
 Those identified as non-salvageable and who survived have a high probability of meaningful functional recovery.
 Current trauma scoring systems are in need of revision to better identify non-salvageable survivors and those children who will not make a meaningful neurologic recovery.
