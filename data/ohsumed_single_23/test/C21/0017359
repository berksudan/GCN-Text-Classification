Associations between alcohol and cocaine use in a sample of problem-drinking employees.
 Increases in cocaine use have created a new and challenging cohort of problem drinkers with dual or multiple addictions.
 As part of a randomized trial comparing alternative alcoholism treatments at a 10,000-employee industrial plant, we interviewed 224 new alcoholic clients of an employee assistance program (EAP); 40% used cocaine during the 6 months just prior to EAP intake.
 Compared to employees reporting no recent cocaine use, the cocaine users were younger, less often married and reported heavier drinking and more alcohol-related problems, on the job and off.
 Even after controlling for demographic and occupational factors, and drinking indicators, cocaine users reported more binges (being drunk 24 hours or more), more blackouts (marginally significant, p = .06), more absenteeism and more warnings about unacceptable job performance.
 Alcoholic EAP clients who use cocaine appear to engage in riskier drinking and to have more trouble on the job than do those who report no cocaine use, and this seems to be a difference specifically attributable to their use of cocaine.
