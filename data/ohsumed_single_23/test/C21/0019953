Platelet-derived growth factor-BB and transforming growth factor beta 1 selectively modulate glycosaminoglycans, collagen, and myofibroblasts in excisional wounds.
 Recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) influence the rate of extracellular matrix formed in treated incisional wounds.
 Because incisional healing processes are difficult to quantify, a full-thickness excisional wound model in the rabbit ear was developed to permit detailed analyses of growth-factor-mediated tissue repair.
 In the present studies, quantitative and qualitative differences in acute inflammatory cell influx, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) deposition, collagen formation, and myofibroblast generation in PDGF-BB (BB homodimer)- and TGF-beta 1-treated wounds were detected when analyzed histochemically and ultrastructurally.
 Although both growth factors significantly augmented extracellular matrix formation and healing in 10-day wounds compared with controls (P less than 0.002).
 PDGF-BB markedly increased macrophage influx and GAG deposition, whereas TGF-beta 1 selectively induced significantly more mature collagen bundles at the leading edge of new granulation tissue (P = 0.007).
 Transforming growth factor-beta 1-treated wound fibroblasts demonstrated active collagen fibrillogenesis and accretion of subfibrils at the ultrastructural level.
 Myofibroblasts, phenotypically modified fibroblasts considered responsible for wound contraction, were observed in control, but were absent in early growth-factor-treated granulating wounds.
 These results provide important insights into the mechanisms of soft tissue repair and indicate that 1) PDGF-BB induces an inflammatory response and provisional matrix synthesis within wounds that is qualitatively similar but quantitatively increased compared with normal wounds; 2) TGF-beta 1 preferentially triggers synthesis and more rapid maturation of collagen within early wounds; and 3) both growth factors inhibit the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, perhaps because wound contraction is not required, due to increased extracellular matrix synthesis.
