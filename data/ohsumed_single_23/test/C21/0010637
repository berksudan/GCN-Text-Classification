Fractures of the coracoid process: presentation of seven cases and review of the literature.
 Coracoid process fracture is a rare and uncommon clinical entity.
 Seven cases of the base of the coracoid process are presented.
 This fracture was isolated in one case, being in the other six cases combined with injuries, either to acromioclavicular dislocation or to fracture of the superior glenoid cavity disorder.
 One of these patients had associated fractures of the clavicle and the coracoid process.
 The treatment was conservative in all cases.
 Results were satisfactory and therefore nonoperative management is advocated.
