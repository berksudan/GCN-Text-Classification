Trajectory reconstructions. I: Trace evidence in flight.
 This paper reviews the use of trace evidence recovered from spent bullets in helping to establish trajectories.
 The use of information derived from such trace evidence combined with that from geometrical techniques of trajectory reconstruction and other data is discussed.
 Five cases are reviewed in which the analysis of trace evidential materials adhering to bullets was used to help reconstruct the event.
