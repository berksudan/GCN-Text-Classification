On the importance of planned health education. Prevention of ski injury as an example.
 The planning of health education aimed at preventing sports injuries is often incomplete and not stated explicitly.
 In most instances, the evaluation is incomplete or nonexistent.
 We present a theoretical framework for planning and evaluating health education, illustrating the main points by using as an example the health education for downhill skiers.
 Systematic planning consists of analyzing the magnitude of the problem and the behavioral risk factors, studying behavior determinants, designing an optimal intervention, and implementing the intervention.
 The evaluation phase deals with the effects on these five levels (implementation, intervention, determinants, behavior, and incidence of injury).
 Some common pitfalls are mentioned and special attention is given to the study of determinants of behavior and to the design of the intervention.
 The importance of pretesting health education material and the community approach in educating sports participants is underlined.
 Health education, together with regulations and facilities, constitutes the health promotion strategy in the prevention of sports injuries.
 For most sports, there seems to be a strong need for further research on the etiology and determinants of behavior before effective prevention can be realized.
