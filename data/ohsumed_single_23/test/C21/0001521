Managing segmental facial nerve injuries by surgical repair.
 This report describes our experiences and evolving philosophy with regard to managing segmental facial nerve injuries.
 We present the results of 13 facial nerve repairs of traumatic injury to a segment of the facial nerve.
 All peripheral facial nerve branches contribute essential elements to normal mimetic facial movement; therefore, we recommend early, appropriate repair of the nerve segment.
 This recommendation is based on principles established for managing disruptions of the main trunk of the facial nerve.
 It offers the patient the chance for complete recovery of facial function.
