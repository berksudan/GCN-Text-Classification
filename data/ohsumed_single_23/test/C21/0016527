Use of a composite skin graft composed of cultured human keratinocytes and fibroblasts and a collagen-GAG matrix to cover full-thickness wounds on athymic mice.
 In patients with extensive full-thickness burns, wound coverage may be accelerated if skin can be expanded to produce a skin replacement that reproducibly supplies blood to the wound and has good structural qualities.
 In addition, development of skin replacements may benefit patients who require reconstruction or replacement of large areas of abnormal skin.
 We have developed a composite skin replacement composed of cultured human keratinocytes (HK) and fibroblasts.
 Cultured human fibroblasts are seeded into the interstices, and cultured HKs are applied to the surface of a matrix composed of type I collagen crosslinked with a glycosaminoglycan, which has a defined physical structure.
 After HKs reach confluence on the matrix surface, the composite grafts are placed on full-thickness wounds on the dorsum of athymic mice.
 Graft acceptance, confirmed by positive staining with antibodies specific for human HLA-ABC antigens on HKs, is approximately 90%.
 A defined skin structure is present histologically by day 10 after grafting, with a differentiated epithelium and a subepidermal layer densely populated by fibroblasts and capillaries without evidence of inflammation.
 Fluorescent light microscopy to identify laminin and type IV collagen and electron microscopy confirm the presence of basement membrane components by 10 days after grafting.
 Attachment of the graft to the wound is similar with and without the addition of human basic fibroblast growth factor, a potent angiogenic agent, to the skin replacement before graft placement on wounds.
