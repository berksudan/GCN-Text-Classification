A descriptive summary of New Jersey's 1985 burn population.
 Data obtained from the New Jersey State Department of Health on the 1985 hospitalized patients with burns and data collected from the National Burn Victim Foundation's standard burn reporting form were analyzed to gather information about the epidemiology of burns.
 Children (0 to 4 years of age) continue to be the largest percentage of the 0- to 18-year-old age group who sustain burn injuries, and 67% of those injuries are sustained by children under the age of 5.
 Males accounted for 69% of the total burn population; 58% of admissions were white; 69% of patients were admitted for partial-thickness burns, and 31% were admitted for full-thickness burns; the largest primary payer was third-party payers; and 92% of patients with burns were discharged to home or self-care.
 Data were also analyzed by examination of selected age groups to determine individual needs of specific groups.
 An analysis of burn injuries reported to the National Burn Victim Foundation confirmed previous reports that the home is the most likely place for a burn injury to occur and that flame and scald injuries predominate; scald injuries comprise 50% of all sustained burns.
 Gasoline vapors accounted for 54% of burn injuries caused by flames.
 The data supported efforts to develop programs that address the needs of the urban child, the 17- to 19-year-old age groups, and the elderly.
 The information that was collected served to redefine objectives for burn prevention programs.
