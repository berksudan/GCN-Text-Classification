Alcohol abuse in adolescents.
 Alcohol abuse among teenagers is an increasing problem with serious physical and social consequences.
 Early diagnosis of adolescent alcoholism may be delayed for two reasons: the physical indicators of alcohol abuse seen in adults are often not identifiable in teenagers, and alcoholism is generally believed to be an adult problem.
 If the history is taken carefully, with respect and confidentiality, it can help the family physician determine the extent of a young person's alcohol abuse and begin the process of treatment for both the adolescent patient and the family.
