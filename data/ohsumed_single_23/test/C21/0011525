The use of human skin in the fabrication of a bite mark template: two case reports.
 Comparison of a suspected biter's dental arches with the patterned injury of a bite mark is especially difficult when the bite occurs in an anatomic location with a small radius of curvature or with complex or compound curves.
 The authors present two case reports in which human skin was used as a template for the reproduction of a bite.
 In one case the victim's skin was used; in the other, the skin of a anatomically similar person was used.
 The use of inked dental casts, photography, and transparent overlays significantly reduced the errors common to analysis of bite marks in these highly curved areas.
