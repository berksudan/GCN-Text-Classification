Psychological absorption. Affect investment in marijuana intoxication.
 Absorption (a trait capacity for total attentional involvement) was reported to increase during episodes of marijuana intoxication.
 Several subsets of the absorption scale items specifically characterized marijuana intoxication, and groups of users and nonusers showed differential affective involvement with these experiences.
 Additionally, within the drug-using group, a positive correlation between frequency of marijuana use and affective ratings of these experiences was found.
 The findings support the hypothesis that a specific type of alteration in consciousness that enhances capacity for total attentional involvement (absorption) characterizes marijuana intoxication, and that this enhancement may act as a reinforcer, possibly influencing future use.
