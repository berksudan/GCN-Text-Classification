Injecting drug use and female street-working prostitution in Glasgow.
 There are considerable difficulties associated with calculating the prevalence of covert, illegal and stigmatized activities.
 This paper outlines new methods we have developed for calculating the prevalence of both drug-injecting street prostitution and non-injecting street prostitution in Glasgow.
 Our data indicate that Glasgow has a much higher level of injecting drug use than has been reported among prostitutes in other British cities.
