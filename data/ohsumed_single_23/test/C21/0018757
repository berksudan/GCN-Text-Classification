It may be more significant than you think: BB air rifle injury to a child's head.
 BB guns of 20 years ago were constructed of coils and springs which generated relatively little force, so that a projectile posed little threat of serious injury.
 Today, the coil and spring construction has been replaced by pump action pneumatic chambers which allow generation of muzzle velocities near 350 ft/sec.
 Speeds of 150 ft/sec and 200 ft/sec are required for skin penetration and bone penetration, respectively.
 We present a seven-year-old boy who suffered intracranial parenchymal injury from an air-powered BB gun projectile while playing with friends.
 We discuss literature which suggests these once-innocent toys are now harbingers of severe, if not fatal, injury.
