Tibial defects. Reconstruction using the method of Ilizarov as an alternative.
 Although used in the USSR since the 1950s, the method of Ilizarov has only recently been employed in North America to manage bone defects.
 Seven cases of patients with tibial bone defects are presented (five with deep infection) that were treated by gradual compression at the defect with one or two transported tibial segments that not only filled the tibial defect but preserved or regained the original bone length.
 Six of the seven patients had their defect obliterated while leg length was maintained.
 The method is minimally invasive, allows immediate weight-bearing and permits modifications in strategy while treating the bone defects but requires close attention to detail and has a steep learning curve.
