Anterolateral ankle dislocation without fracture.
 Dislocation of the tibiotalar joint without associated fracture is rare.
 We have presented a case of open anterolateral ankle dislocation with complete ligamentous disruption.
 In contrast to reports that internal fixation is not required to maintain reduction of tibiotalar joint dislocation, we found this dislocation to be grossly unstable, requiring both a syndesmotic screw and a calcaneotalotibial transfixing pin for stabilization.
