Analysis of 46 intra-abdominal aortic injuries from blunt trauma: case reports and literature review.
 Blunt trauma causing aortic injury is infrequent and primarily involves the thoracic aorta.
 Abdominal aortic injury after blunt trauma is much less frequent and has a varied presentation.
 Within a 3-month period, our trauma unit diagnosed and treated two cases of abdominal aortic injury secondary to blunt trauma.
 One was a belted passenger in a motor vehicle accident, and one was secondary to a crush injury.
 The addition of these two cases brings the number found in the literature to 46.
 Reviewing these cases has emphasized the need for prompt recognition and treatment of this vascular catastrophe.
