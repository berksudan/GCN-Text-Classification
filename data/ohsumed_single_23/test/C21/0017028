Varus of the talus in the ankle mortise secondary to calcaneus fracture. A case report.
 Varus displacement of the talus in the ankle mortise secondary to a calcaneus fracture was observed in a 33-year-old man.
 Similar to the calcaneus fracture-dislocation, the mechanism involved inferior and medial displacement of the talus into the body of the calcaneus.
 The patient's ankle deformity was not corrected by a lateral ankle ligament reconstruction.
 Correction required a distraction subtalar bone block fusion.
 Successful reconstruction of the hindfoot after calcaneus fractures requires a careful analysis of the pathologic lesion.
 In this unusual case, correction required restoration of lost hindfoot bone structure.
