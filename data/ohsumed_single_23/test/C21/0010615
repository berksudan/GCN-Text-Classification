The management of large soft-tissue defects following close-range shotgun injury.
 Large soft-tissue defects following close-range shotgun blasts remain a major technical challenge to trauma surgeons.
 During the period 1980 through 1988, 43 patients who survived greater than 48 hours following this injury were managed in our center.
 The locations of their soft-tissue defects were: extremity, 22; abdomen/chest, 18; and head/neck, three.
 All patients underwent immediate surgical exploration and wide debridement of all devitalized tissue along with repair of associated injuries.
 Management included mandatory frequent dressing changes, debridement, irrigation in the operating room, and the perioperative administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
 Four patients whose abdominal wall defects could not be initially closed had temporary placement of rayon cloth to prevent evisceration.
 Overall, four patients underwent delayed primary closure, eight were covered with split-thickness skin grafts, nine had closure with myocutaneous flaps, and 19 closed by secondary intent.
 Two patients, who were transferred to us following initial management, developed wound sepsis due to inadequate debridement and both eventually required amputation as did one patient who developed early myonecrosis following lengthy arterial repair.
 Frequent operative dressing changes, adequate debridement, and irrigation minimize sepsis following close-range shotgun blasts and should be the treatment of choice for this devastating injury.
 Techniques of wound closure need to be individualized to the particular situation.
