Some boundary conditions for effective use of alcohol placebos.
 The present research assessed the conditions under which subjects who consume alcohol and those who consume a placebo beverage, and who report consuming alcohol on a manipulation check question, are equivalent with respect to subjective responses to alcohol.
 Male subjects were told that they were drinking alcohol and consumed one of four beverages: alcoholic beer, nonalcoholic beer, vodka and tonic with lime, or tonic with lime.
 Measures of subjective intoxication, body sensations and breath alcohol were taken at different times during and after beverage consumption.
 Subjective intoxication ratings were higher for subjects who received alcohol, compared to subjects who received a placebo and reported consuming alcohol, when alcohol subjects achieved blood alcohol concentrations at and above .04%.
 These two groups did not differ in subjective intoxication ratings when alcohol subjects achieved blood alcohol concentrations below .04%.
 These data suggest that the orthogonal manipulation of alcohol consumption and expectancy effects is problematic at and above blood alcohol concentrations of .04%.
