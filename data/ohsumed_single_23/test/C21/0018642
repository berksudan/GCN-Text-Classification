Management of auto-emasculation in the psychotic state.
 We report 2 cases of self-inflicted penile amputations, which offered differing surgical options and contrasting surgical results due to varying time delays.
 In 1 case repair was done immediately, while repair in the other case was delayed by 3 days due to the psychotic state of the patient.
 The psychiatric backgrounds of such episodes are discussed, as well as the techniques of repair and reconstruction.
