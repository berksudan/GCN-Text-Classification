Sex differences in personality traits and coping styles of hospitalized alcoholics.
 Forty inpatients on an alcohol detoxication unit of a large municipal hospital were administered a battery of tests consisting of a Coping Styles scale, a Personality Profile scale, a Depression scale and the Brief MAST.
 A demographically comparable comparison group of 40 outpatients attending the medical screening clinic at the same hospital also completed the battery.
 The two groups did not differ in terms of age, education or the ratio of men to women.
 There were significant differences in coping styles and personality characteristics between alcoholics and nonalcoholics and, to a large extent, between men and women within the alcoholic group.
 Practically no significant differences were found between the men in the two groups, but female alcoholics differed greatly from nonalcoholic women in terms of coping styles, personality variables and also in terms of conflict.
 These findings indicate that the differences between alcoholic and nonalcoholics in the sample were due largely to patterns uniquely characterizing the female alcoholic group.
 Results are discussed in terms of cultural expectations.
