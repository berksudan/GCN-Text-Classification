Depression among alcoholics in a Turkish sample.
 The aim of the present study was to identify the predictor variables of depression among alcoholics in a Turkish mental hospital.
 A questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were utilized to collect data from 71 male alcoholics.
 A stepwise multiple regression analysis between the BDI scores and demographic and health-related variables resulted in the identification of marital problems and physical problems due to alcohol as the risk factors.
 The findings are discussed within the context of the findings from Western countries and the similarities are pointed out.
