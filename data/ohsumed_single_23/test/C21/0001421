Management of complex perineal soft-tissue injuries.
 Debridement, fecal diversion, and rectal washout have been proposed as the primary therapy for complex perineal lacerations, but, in most series, survivors have a pelvic sepsis rate of 40-80%.
 In a retrospective study, six of 18 patients sustaining severe perineal lacerations died within the first few hours of injury due to exsanguination from pelvic injuries.
 The remaining 12 patients underwent sigmoidoscopy, diversion of the fecal stream with irrigation of the distal rectal stump, and radical initial debridement of necrotic soft tissue.
 Enteral access was obtained in two patients.
 In the patients with mandatory daily debridement and pulsatile irrigation, no pelvic sepsis occurred.
 In three patients without daily debridement, pelvic sepsis complicated recovery.
 The ability of patients to resume oral nutrition was significantly delayed, necessitating total parenteral nutrition in three patients.
 We conclude that sigmoidoscopy, total diversion of the fecal stream with irrigation of the distal rectal stump, enteral access for feeding, radical initial debridement of necrotic soft tissue, and mandatory daily debridement with pulsatile irrigation optimize recovery from this devastating injury.
