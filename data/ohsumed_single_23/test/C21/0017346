Successful replantation of both legs in a child--5-year followup: case report.
 Replantation of lower extremities is an infrequent procedure, and is rarely indicated, due to the usual severity of the primary injury plus the possibility of good prosthetic substitution.
 We report a case of successful replantation of both legs in an 8-year-old boy (despite Aspergillus flavus septicemia) with followup of 5 years.
 This case suggests that leg replantation should be considered in young patients.
 This appears to be the second reported case of successful replantation of both legs.
