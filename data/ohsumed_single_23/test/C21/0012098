Acute alcohol ingestion reduces fatty acid extraction of the heart, liver, and small intestine.
 Ethanol may have profound effects on both the distribution of perfusion and substrate utilization by the liver and heart due to its vasodilating properties and the generation of high levels of circulating acetate and lactate.
 Since fatty acids are highly extracted by the heart and liver under normal circumstances, changes in the relationship of perfusion/fatty acid uptake may be a sensitive indicator of both altered perfusion and changes in metabolic substrate availability.
 To test this hypothesis, studies were performed in rats fed 3.1, 6.2, and 9.3 g/kg doses of ethanol.
 Fatty acid uptake was estimated with a 3-methyl substituted reagent with a chain length equivalent to 17 carbons.
 The methyl group in the three position prevented beta oxidation and prolonged the residence of fatty acids in the tissue.
 Eighteen hours after acute alcohol administration, fatty acid uptake was reduced in the heart and the small intestine; in the liver uptake was increased or unchanged.
 Acute ethanol administration also resulted in increased perfusion, as indicated by enhanced uptake of 201thallium by the heart, liver, and small intestine.
 The fatty acid extraction of the heart, liver, and small intestine, defined as the concentration of fatty acid divided by the concentration of 201thallium, was markedly decreased by alcohol ingestion.
 These alcohol effects were dose-dependent and temporally related.
 The data suggest that ethanol ingestion could potentially alter heart function during exercise or following a prolonged fast, when the heart relies primarily upon fatty acids extracted from the circulation to generated adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
