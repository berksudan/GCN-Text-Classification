Theodor Kocher and the Scientific Foundation of Wound Ballistics.
 The systemic and rational approach used by Kocher, coupled with his interest in research of wound ballistics for more than 40 years, resulted in a clear elucidation of the principles that form the basic scientific foundation of modern wound ballistics.
 The validity of his work has been proved repeatedly on the battlefields of the world for more than a century.
 Presently, more than ever before, the sound scientific precepts revealed by Kocher are essential to keep technologic investigation within the framework of good judgment.
