Individualized care for the treatment of alcoholism.
 Through a discussion of several case vignettes, the author emphasizes the utilization of an individually tailored treatment approach when working with people experiencing problems related to alcohol consumption.
 Patients may achieve abstinence without believing in the disease concept of alcoholism, and attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings need not always be a part of the treatment.
 Furthermore, for some patients, controlled drinking may be as desirable an outcome as abstinence.
 The importance of entertaining a multiplicity of perspectives when conducting clinical work with such patients is discussed.
