Responsible alcohol service: a study of server, manager, and environmental impact.
 A responsible alcohol-service training program was evaluated for its impact on changing beliefs, knowledge, and behavior in 97 servers and 43 managers and on changing establishment policies that encourage safer drinking environments.
 The training program had a significant impact on changing the beliefs and knowledge of both servers and managers.
 Observation 4 to 6 weeks after training showed no effects on server behavior, but there was a tendency toward more establishment policies compared with controls.
