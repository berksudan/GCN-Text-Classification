Clinical utility of a position-monitoring catheter in the pulmonary artery.
 Unsuspected distal migration of the tip of the pulmonary artery catheter may cause life-threatening complications.
 We prospectively evaluated the clinical utility of the PA Watch Catheter in 25 patients after cardiac surgery by hourly measurements of pulmonary artery (distal lumen), right ventricular (middle lumen), and central venous (proximal lumen) pressures.
 The catheter was considered to be in the proper position when the middle lumen port, located 10 cm from the tip, transmitted a right ventricular pressure waveform.
 Satisfactory initial catheter placement was obtained in 24 of 25 patients.
 During the 28.4 +/- 1.8 h of postoperative monitoring, clinically unsuspected distal catheter migration, indicated by the presence of a pulmonary artery pressure waveform in the middle lumen port, occurred in 12 of the 25 patients (48%).
 In these patients, 20 episodes occurred and required catheter withdrawal distances of 1.8 +/- 0.3 cm (range 1-6 cm).
 The PA Watch Catheter proved to be a useful indicator of unsuspected distal catheter migration in the postoperative period.
 The PA Watch Catheter allows assessment of catheter tip placement in the proximal pulmonary artery and may decrease catheter-induced complications.
