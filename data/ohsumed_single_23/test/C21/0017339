Results of operative treatment for intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus.
 Since 1980 our treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures consists of open reduction with distractor, bone grafting, and internal fixation.
 Thereby no splints are applied and early postoperative movement is possible.
 For precise preoperative planning a CT scan is required.
 Proper timing and careful preoperative planning are essential to prevent soft-tissue complications.
 In a total of 16 fractures good clinical and radiologic results were achieved in 50% of the cases; results were satisfactory in 25% and poor in 25%.
 The patients returned to work after an average of 5 months.
 Only three patients (19%) received disability compensations, which compares favorably with nonoperative treatment.
 We believe that a majority of comminuted intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus profit from open reduction and internal fixation and that more reliable functional results are achieved than with conservative therapy.
