Tears of cruciate ligaments and menisci: evaluation with cine MR imaging.
 A cine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique, involving the acquisition of kinematic sagittal images during knee movement, was used to evaluate 52 symptomatic knee joints.
 Results were compared with those obtained by means of static three-dimensional (3D) MR imaging.
 Twenty-seven of the 28 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and 22 of 24 normal ligaments were correctly identified at cine MR imaging for a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 92%.
 Static 3D MR imaging yielded a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 88%.
 All four posterior cruciate ligament tears were identified at cine and 3D MR imaging.
 For meniscal tears, cine MR imaging yielded a sensitivity of 48% and a specificity of 96%; the sensitivity and specificity for 3D MR imaging were 71% and 96%, respectively.
 Cine MR imaging proved to be more useful than static MR imaging in assessing the tightness of cruciate ligaments, especially of those that were partially torn, and in assessing the movement of meniscal-free fragments.
 The increased information obtained with cine MR imaging may warrant continued investigation and clinical application.
