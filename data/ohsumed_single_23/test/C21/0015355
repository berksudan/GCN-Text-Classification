Motorcycle licensure, ownership, and injury crash involvement.
 The interrelationships among motorcycle licensure, ownership, and injury crash involvement were investigated in a sample of 2,723 motorcycle drivers severely or fatally injured in California in 1985-86.
 Owners of motorcycles in such crashes ("driver-owners") were less likely to have valid licenses than a random sample of motorcycle owners who had not been in crashes (42 vs.
 57 percent).
 Thirty-three percent of the crash-involved drivers had valid motorcycle driver's licenses; 39 percent were operating motorcycles they did not own ("driver-nonowners").
 Driver-nonowners were less likely to be validly licensed than driver-owners (20 percent vs.
 44 percent).
 The licensing rate of crash-involved driver-nonowners was 15 percent if the owner was also unlicensed.
 Rates of valid licensure were lowest among the youngest drivers.
 Virtually no crash-involved driver-nonowners under age 21 were licensed in cases in which the owner was also young and unlicensed.
