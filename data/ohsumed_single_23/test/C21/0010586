Movement of hemostatic clips from the ventricles through the aqueduct to the lumbar spinal canal. Case report.
 The authors report a patient in whom rebleeding after operation for a left temporal arteriovenous malformation resulted in the dislocation of multiple hemostatic clips.
 Several clips, including a Yasargil aneurysm clip, were detected incidentally in the lumbar spinal canal.
 No clinical signs or symptoms were noted.
 Retrospectively, passage of the aneurysm clip through the aqueduct could be detected on computerized tomography scans performed to evaluate a series of epileptic seizures.
