Management of smooth-blunt gastric foreign bodies in asymptomatic patients.
 Guidelines for management in the asymptomatic patient with a smooth-blunt gastric foreign body are not well established in the pediatric literature.
 Questionnaires were sent to pediatricians, family practitioners, pediatric gastroenterologists and pediatric surgeons with an over-all response rate of 62.2%.
 There was no agreement in regard to how long one should observe such patients before recommending intervention.
 There was no correlation of years of clinical experience and length of observation recommended either.
 Review of the pre-endoscopic literature revealed spontaneous evacuation in 93-99% of all types of foreign bodies in 1477 pediatric patients.
 An observation period of at least eight weeks should be strongly considered in an asymptomatic patient with a smooth-blunt gastric foreign body.
 Exceptions would include an anatomic abnormality of the gastric outlet, previous gastric outlet surgery as well as a possibly toxic object.
