Pes anserinus interposition in a proximal tibial physeal fracture. A case report.
 A ten-year-old girl suffered a Salter-Harris Type II fracture of the proximal tibia.
 Inspection revealed interposition of the pes anserinus (PA) within the open physis, which prevented reduction.
 This may be the first case report of PA interposition.
