High-pressure injection injuries of the hand.
 The majority of high-pressure injection injuries can produce serious damage to the hand.
 Nevertheless, the injury may follow a relatively benign course if the injected substance possesses a less harmful nature.
 Treatment for these injuries requires immediate and aggressive surgery in most circumstances, but conservative treatment may be justified in certain instances.
 During a 4-year period, eight cases of high-pressure injection injury were encountered.
 The types of injected material were: four from paint, and one each from grease, water, benzene, and hydraulic oil.
 Time is an important factor regarding the results, while the types of injected material modify the clinical courses.
 It is advisable that the etiology of high-pressure injection injury should be established initially, and this factor be taken into consideration in choosing treatment options.
