The prognostic significance of radiologically detected knee joint effusions in the absence of associated fracture.
 The significance of radiologically detected knee joint effusion as a marker of soft tissue injury following trauma is uncertain.
 In this study 100 patients presenting to the casualty department following acute injury, with effusions but no fracture, were assessed.
 Of those available for follow-up, 20% required further investigation and 11% proceeded to surgery for significant soft tissue injury.
 It is concluded that radiologically detected knee joint effusions are a useful marker for underlying soft tissue injury.
