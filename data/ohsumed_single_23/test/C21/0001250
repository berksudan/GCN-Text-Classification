Comparison of functional recovery after nonsurgical and surgical treatment of condylar fractures.
 This article evaluates 16 cases of condylar fracture treated surgically, comparing them with the 20 cases treated nonsurgically, with a 2-year follow-up.
 Although severely displaced and luxated fractures were involved in the surgical group with rigid internal fixation, satisfactory postoperative function and occlusion were achieved at the same level as in the nonsurgical group, without severe complications.
