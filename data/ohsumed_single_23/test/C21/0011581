The Gillies method for fractured zygomas: an analysis of 105 cases.
 This prospective study analyzed 105 cases treated using the Gillies temporal approach for fractures of the zygoma.
 In 97 cases (92%) this was sufficient.
 Only eight cases required open reduction.
 It is suggested that the Gillies method be used more frequently, because it is associated with minimal morbidity and a short duration of general anesthesia.
