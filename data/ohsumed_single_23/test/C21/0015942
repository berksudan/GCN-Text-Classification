Bone structure after removal of internal fixation plates.
 We used single-photon absorptiometry to assess the forearm bones after the removal of internal fixation plates in 14 patients.
 We found convincing evidence of cortical atrophy in only one patient, in whom the plates had been removed prematurely after only 16 months.
 It is suggested that such plates should be retained for at least 21 months, to allow bone density to return to its prefracture level.
 The recommendations of the AO/ASIF group are supported.
