Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for acute smoke inhalation injuries.
 Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an important adjunct in the management of respiratory injuries secondary to smoke inhalation, especially when injury is complicated by inhalation of a toxic chemical such as carbon monoxide or cyanide.
 For carbon monoxide poisoning, such therapy has become a standard of practice.
 As more information becomes available concerning the ability of hyperbaric oxygen to reduce reperfusion injuries, we anticipate that this therapy will become a standard of practice for managing smoke inhalation injuries and cyanide poisoning as well.
