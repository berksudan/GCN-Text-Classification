Community screening for hypercholesterolemia.
 This study focused on a cholesterol screening and education program conducted in Scottsdale, Arizona, to determine the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia among the volunteer participants, and whether such a program motivates lifestyle changes and physician follow-up.
 The study also examined whether participants used the program to monitor known hypercholesterolemia.
 During the 6-month program, 1228 individuals were screened.
 Of these, 29% had a previous history of elevated cholesterol and 5% were on cholesterol-lowering medication.
 Of the group with no previous history of hypercholesterolemia, 41% had cholesterol levels higher than 5.17 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) and 10% had levels higher than 6.21 mmol/L (240 mg/dL).
 A subgroup of 120 persons with levels higher than 6.21 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) were contacted 4 to 6 months after the screening.
 Most of this group reported improvement in diet and exercise patterns, and 58% had consulted a physician.
 These results suggest that people with known hypercholesterolemia are using community screening programs to monitor their own cholesterol levels, and that such programs identity new high-risk individuals.
 Program participants appear to change diet and exercise patterns and to seek physician follow-up.
