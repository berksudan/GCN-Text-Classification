A dietary education program for hypercholesterolemic children and their parents.
 A parent-child autotutorial dietary education program for 4- to 10-year-old, hypercholesterolemic children and their families was developed and pilot tested.
 The 10-lesson program, designed for weekly use at home, uses a "talking-book" approach (audiotapes with accompanying picture booklet) for the child.
 Parents are provided with information on ways to make recommended dietary changes, along with hands-on activities to do with the children.
 To help match the instructional approach to the wide developmental range within the children's age span, materials are divided into three program levels that use different story characters and concept presentations.
 During program development, evaluation by two children (and their parents) for each of the program levels guided the design and refinement of the lessons.
 A pilot test among 22 hypercholesterolemic children (whose treatment was limited to diet modification) revealed that children within the 4- to 10-year age range liked the "talking-book" approach and identified positively with the story characters.
 Parents indicated that their materials were clear and helpful.
 Between the baseline and 3-month follow-up visits, the children exhibited a significant increase in knowledge of heart healthy foods, a decrease in total fat consumption that approached significance, and a significant decrease in plasma low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol values.
