Suppression of chromogranin-A release from neuroendocrine sources in man: pharmacological studies.
 Chromogranin-A (CgA) is an acidic soluble protein with a virtually ubiquitous occurrence in normal human neuroendocrine tissues.
 Of the many potential tissue sources of CgA immunoreactivity, which contribute to basal (unstimulated) circulating CgA? To explore this question we studied the effects of selective and nonselective suppression of secretion at several sites within the neuroendocrine system.
 Selective disruption of sympathetic outflow by trimethaphan decreased basal CgA by 25%, suggesting that sympathetic neurons contribute to circulating CgA.
 Plasma CgA in patients with unilateral and bilateral adrenalectomy fell within the range observed in normal subjects, weighing against the adrenal medulla as a major source of basal circulating CgA.
 Selective suppression of a variety of anterior and posterior pituitary cell types decreased plasma levels of the usual resident peptide hormones, but left plasma CgA unperturbed.
 After propranolol treatment, plasma CgA remained unaltered.
 Secretin suppressed plasma PTH and calcitonin, but did not alter plasma CgA levels.
 On the other hand, widespread nonselective suppression of a variety of neuroendocrine secretory cells by somatostatin decreased plasma CgA by 48%.
 Plasma catecholamines were unaltered by somatostatin infusion, suggesting that somatostatin inhibited CgA release from nonsympathoadrenal sources.
 During the infusion of somatostatin, the plasma epinephrine increment in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was maintained, and plasma CgA did not fall, nor did it rise after somatostatin cessation.
 Taken together, these findings suggest that somatostatin did not inhibit transport of stimulation-released CgA from the adrenal medulla to the circulation.
 In conclusion, although the adrenal medulla is the major tissue source of CgA immunoreactivity in man, other neuroendocrine sites, including sympathetic axons and multiple endocrine glands, appear to influence the basal circulating concentration of CgA.
