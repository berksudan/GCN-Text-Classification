Effect of educational program and interview on adoption of guidelines for the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
 OBJECTIVES: To determine (a) whether physicians are adhering to the guidelines for the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, (b) what influences their decisions to investigate and treat the condition and (c) the effect of an educational program and clinical recall interview on compliance with the guidelines.
 DESIGN: Retrospective chart audit.
 SETTING: Urban tertiary care hospital.
 PARTICIPANTS: All term neonates who received phototherapy but were not admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.
 INTERVENTIONS: Educational program and clinical recall interview.
 MEASURES: Charts were reviewed from March to May 1986 (period I, before publication of the guidelines) and from November 1986 to January 1987 (period II, after publication and after the educational program).
 The audits were repeated from April to June 1989 (period III, during the interview phase) and from October to December 1989 (period IV, 6 months after the interviews).
 Two criteria determined the appropriate use of phototherapy: the serum bilirubin level and the postnatal day on which phototherapy was started.
 RESULTS: The proportion of infants receiving phototherapy for whom there were orders for complete blood counts to investigate hyperbilirubinemia increased from 20% in period I to 37% in period IV.
 The frequency of orders to determine the proportion of reticulocytes did not change significantly.
 The number of infants receiving phototherapy decreased over the study periods.
 The proportion receiving phototherapy in accordance with the criteria for the serum bilirubin level increased from 10% to 17% after the educational program (insignificant difference) and to 31% after the interviews (p = 0.02).
 Compliance with the guidelines was greater before the infants were 2 days old than when they were 3 days old or more (p = 0.01).
 Of the 45 physicians who prescribed phototherapy (for 94 infants) during period IV 26 never prescribed in accordance with the guidelines.
 The other 19 prescribed in accordance with the guidelines for 30 of 52 infants.
 Decisions to investigate and treat with phototherapy were affected by clinical and parental factors in addition to the guidelines.
 Two of the 25 physicians interviewed stated that the interview would influence their management of future cases of hyperbilirubinemia.
 CONCLUSION: A clinical recall interview can have a greater impact on changing physician management practices than factual communication on a group basis.
