Effect of vitamin C depletion on serum cholesterol and lipoprotein levels in ODS (od/od) rats unable to synthesize ascorbic acid.
 The effect of ascorbic acid deficiency on serum and liver cholesterol, phospholipid and triglyceride levels, serum lipoprotein levels and serum lipoprotein cholesterol levels were examined in male rats with a hereditary defect in ascorbic acid synthesis (ODS rats).
 Male homozygotes (od/od) and male rats of their parent strain (+/+) were each divided into four treatment groups and were fed vitamin C-deficient or vitamin C-replete diets containing either 0 or 0.5% cholesterol.
 During the 3-wk feeding-period the ODS (od/od) rats fed the vitamin C-deficient diet gradually decreased food intake, resulting in a lower body weight than that of od/od rats given ascorbic acid.
 The serum cholesterol level was significantly higher in the vitamin C-deficient od/od rats fed the cholesterol diet, and it tended to be higher in those fed the control (0% cholesterol) diet, whereas the liver lipid levels remained unchanged relative to those in od/od rats fed the vitamin C-replete diet.
 The serum very low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were lower in od/od rats fed the vitamin C-deficient diet without cholesterol, but intermediate density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were markedly higher in the vitamin C-deficient od/od rats than in od/od rats given ascorbic acid, regardless of dietary cholesterol level.
 The ratio of HDL2 cholesterol to HDL3 cholesterol was also higher in the vitamin C-deficient od/od rats.
 The parent strain of the od/od rats (+/+) showed no change due to vitamin C deficiency.
 These results suggest that vitamin C deficiency delays low density lipoprotein metabolism and produces hypercholesterolemia in male od/od rats.
