Lowering the cost of lowering the cholesterol: a formulary policy for lovastatin 
 OBJECTIVES: To describe a medical center policy designed to contain the cost of using the lipid-lowering drug lovastatin in a primary care setting, to examine the effect of the policy on cost containment, and to examine physician acceptance of the policy.
 SETTING: A Veterans Affairs medical center.
 INTERVENTIONS: The policy made lovastatin available to physicians when failure of therapy with diet and two first-line drugs was documented on an order form.
 The form also contained educational information including prices and recommended niacin as the drug treatment of first choice for most patients.
 DESIGN: To evaluate the effect of the policy, lipid-lowering drug use at the medical center was compared with that at a similar center that did not restrict lovastatin use, and with lipid-lowering drug use in the United States as a whole.
 A written questionnaire was used to survey physician reaction to the policy.
 RESULTS: The use of lovastatin as a percentage of total lipid-lowering drug use at the center with the lovastatin policy was one-fourth that at the other center or nationwide, and the use of niacin was four times greater (p less than 0.0001).
 The estimated savings in drug costs to the center with the lovastatin policy due to these differences was more than $30,000 per year.
 In the survey of physicians affected by the policy (n = 78, response rate = 100%), less than one-fourth viewed it unfavorably, and 90% favored this policy over restricting the drug to a subspecialty clinic.
 CONCLUSION: The authors' experience indicates that a formulary policy that permits limited use of an expensive drug in a primary care setting can contain costs in a way that is acceptable to physicians.
 A policy of this type could be useful to the increasing number of health care provider organizations that cover the cost of outpatient medications.
