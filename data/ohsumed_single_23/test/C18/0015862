Production of inhibitor of insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase in fibroblasts from patient with insulin resistance and NIDDM.
 Although non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is associated with defects in insulin action, the molecular basis of this resistance is unknown.
 We studied fibroblasts from a markedly insulin-resistant patient with NIDDM but without acanthosis nigricans.
 Her fibroblasts were resistant to insulin when alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake was measured.
 Fibroblasts from this patient demonstrated normal insulin-receptor content as measured by both insulin-receptor radioimmunoassay and by Scatchard analysis.
 However, when compared with nondiabetic control subjects, insulin-receptor kinase assays of wheat-germ-purified receptors prepared from her fibroblasts showed very low basal and no insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity.
 The insulin receptor was then removed from the wheat-germ fraction by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography.
 This insulin-receptor-deficient fraction inhibited both basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of highly purified insulin receptors.
 When the specificity of this inhibition was tested, less inhibition was seen with insulinlike growth factor I-receptor tyrosine kinase, and even less inhibition was seen with the proto-oncogene p60c-src tyrosine kinase.
 Thus, these studies indicate that fibroblasts from an insulin-resistant patient with NIDDM produce a relatively specific glycoprotein inhibitor of insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase.
 Therefore, these studies raise the possibility that this inhibitor may play an important role in the insulin resistance seen in this patient.
