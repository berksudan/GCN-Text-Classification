Effects of PP-56 and vitamin E on platelet hyperaggregability, fatty acid abnormalities, and clinical manifestations in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats.
 The effects of vitamin E and D-myo-inositol 1,2,6-trisphosphate (PP-56) were investigated in long-term studies in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats fed a purified diet with 33% lipids and a polyunsaturated-to -saturated fatty acid ratio of 1.
 A supplement of vitamin E decreased plasma triglycerides, platelet lipid biosynthesis, some of the delta 6- and delta 5-desaturase abnormalities, and urine ketone bodies but did not affect the response of platelets to aggregation.
 PP-56 completely normalized the platelet reactivity to ADP and thrombin.
 This was accompanied by normalization of platelet lipid biosynthesis and diabetes-induced abnormalities in delta 6- and delta 5-desaturases.
 PP-56 treatment also reduced the mortality rate and to a certain extent urinary ketone bodies.
 The protective effect of PP-56 on platelet aggregation and mortality rate were dose related.
 PP-56, a molecule derived from phytic acid, seems to exert potent protective effects on some of the manifestations associated with diabetes in rats.
