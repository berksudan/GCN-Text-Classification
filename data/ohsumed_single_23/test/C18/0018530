HLA antigens in Hungarian patients with idiopathic haemochromatosis.
 Thirteen unrelated patients with idiopathic haemochromatosis (eight men, five women) were studied.
 The diagnosis was based on clinical, biological, and histochemical findings.
 HLA typing was performed in all 13 and in all of their available first degree relatives (n = 31).
 HLA A3 was present in nine of 13 probands (69.2% compared with 18.8% in the group of 53 healthy blood donors and 22.4% in a selected Hungarian population (n = 1910).
 HLA B7 was present in five of 13 probands (38.4% compared with 11.3% and 14.6%).
 An A3B7 antigen association was found in five of 13 patients.
 The A3B7 haplotype was found in three, A2B12 and A2B38 haplotypes were found twice in 10 genotyped probands.
 Pedigree studies showed that there was one unaffected homozygote, 24 heterozygotes, and six non-carriers.
 Extended family and population studies are necessary to establish the prevalence of the gene in Hungary and an association with haplotypes other than A3B7.
