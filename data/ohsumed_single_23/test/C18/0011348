Effect of exercise and obesity on skeletal muscle amino acid uptake.
 The genetically obese Zucker rat has a reduced capacity to deposit dietary protein in skeletal muscle.
 To determine whether amino acid uptake by muscle of obese Zucker rats is impaired, soleus strip (SOL) and epitrochlearis (EPI) muscles from 10-wk-old lean and obese Zucker rats were studied in vitro by use of [14C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB).
 Muscles from fasted rats were incubated under basal conditions at rest or after a 1-h treadmill run at 8% grade.
 To equate total work completed, lean and obese rats ran at 27 and 20 m/min, respectively.
 Muscles were pinned at resting length, preincubated for 30 min at 37 degrees C in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 5 mM glucose under 95% O2-5% CO2, and then incubated up to 3 h in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate with 0.5 mM AIB, [14C]AIB, and [3H]inulin as a marker of extracellular fluid.
 Basal AIB uptake in EPI and SOL from obese rats was significantly reduced by 40 and 30% (P less than 0.01), respectively, compared with lean rats.
 For both lean and obese rats, exercise increased (P less than 0.05) basal AIB uptake in EPI and SOL, but the relative increases were greater in the obese rats (EPI 54% and SOL 71% vs.
 EPI 32% and SOL 37%).
 These results demonstrate that genetically obese Zucker rats have reduced basal skeletal muscle amino acid uptake and suggest that physical inactivity may partially contribute to this defect.
