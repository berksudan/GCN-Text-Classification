Diabetic retinopathy: can we modify its course?
 With the exception of panretinal laser photocoagulation, no therapy has been shown to modify the course of diabetic retinopathy.
 Success in developing new therapies for diabetic retinopathy will depend on how well the disease process is understood and on whether interventions can be identified that ameliorate or circumvent critical stages in the development of the disease.
 A model of the disease process is presented to serve as a frame-work on which pieces of the puzzle can be placed and new areas of potential interventional therapy can be conceptualized.
