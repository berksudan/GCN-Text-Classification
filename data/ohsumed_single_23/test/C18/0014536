Comparison of the accuracy of glucose reflectance meters in pregnant insulin-dependent diabetics.
 Home monitoring of blood glucose by reflectance meters has been shown to be accurate in the nonpregnant diabetic and is currently used for outpatient glucose control in the pregnant diabetic as well.
 Beckman ASTRA glucose results from samples collected into sodium fluoride were used as the standard for this study.
 Comparisons were then made to four glucose reflectance meters: Accu-Check II, One Touch, DiaScan S, and ExacTech.
 Although the reflectance meters appeared to be useful for assessing blood glucose trends in the pregnant diabetic, the results obtained from these meters would be unacceptable in the laboratory setting.
 Unfortunately, because of the erratic combination of proportional and constant bias, correction factors are not easily ascertained.
 Laboratories and physicians should reconsider the use of these reflectance meters for inpatient evaluation and general population screening of pregnant women.
