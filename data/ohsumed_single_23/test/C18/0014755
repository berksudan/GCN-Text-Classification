Plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity and plasma lipoprotein composition and concentrations in kwashiorkor [published erratum appears in Am J Clin Nutr 1991 Sep;54(3):590]
 Plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity, lipoprotein composition, and lipoprotein concentrations were measured in 21 children with kwashiorkor before (day 1), during (day 10), and after treatment (day 30).
 Day 1 LCAT activity (78.2 mumol.L-1.h-1) was decreased with respect to day 10 (139.2 mumol.L-1.h-1, P less than 0.001) and day 30 (108.0 mumol.L-1.h-1, P = 0.08).
 Plasma total cholesterol (TC), cholesterol ester (CE), and lipoprotein CEs (VLDL, IDL, LDL, and HDL) were reduced relative to days 10 and 30 (P less than 0.001).
 Before treatment HDL composition was abnormal.
 On days 1, 10, and 30, the respective mean HDL-apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) concentrations were 23.33, 39.66, and 36.08 mumol/L.
 LDL-apo B concentrations were 0.40, 0.68, and 0.56 mumol/L (P less than 0.01, days 10 and 30 vs day 1).
 LDL particles on day 1 were decreased in number, depleted of CE, and laden with triacylglycerol and surface lipids.
 LCAT activity on day 1 correlated with LDL-CE linoleate (P less than 0.05, r = 0.48).
 Reduced plasma LCAT activity is an important factor related to abnormalities in lipoprotein composition and concentrations.
