Percent body fat in obese white females predicted by anthropometric measurements.
 The percent body fat (PBF) and 15 anthropometric measurements were measured in 221 obese white females randomly assigned to validation and cross-validation groups.
 Two new anthropometric equations for the prediction of the percent of body fat were generated by multiple regression.
 Equation 1 includes the residual lung volume (RV) as a factor and had a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.85 and a standard error of the estimate (SEE) of 3.9%.
 Equation 2 does not include the RV and has an r of 0.82 and an SEE of 4.3%.
 Both equations were more precise than two previous widely used equations.
 In a subgroup of 37 subjects who underwent weight loss, equation 1 gave a more precise estimate of the change in PBF.
 We conclude that the new equations permit a better prediction of the PBF in obese white females.
