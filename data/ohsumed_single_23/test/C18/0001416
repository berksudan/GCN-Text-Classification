Differential effects of alpha and beta adrenergic blockade on glucose and lactate metabolism during acute stress.
 In this study we examined the role of alpha and beta blockade on glucose and lactate metabolism during the acute stress of insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
 Three groups of conscious dogs with chronically fitted catheters in the femoral artery and in the femoral, portal, and hepatic veins were studied after an 18-hr fast.
 After a 1-hr basal period, hypoglycemia was induced with insulin infusion at 5 mU/kg.min for 3 hr.
 Group 1 received no other treatment.
 Groups 2 and 3 received, respectively, phentolamine (8 micrograms/kg.min) and propranolol (4 micrograms/kg.min) beginning 30 minutes before and throughout the experimental period.
 Despite similar hyperinsulinemia, plasma glucose dropped in Group 1 (from 115 +/- 10 to 40 +/- 3 mg/dl) and in Group 2 (from 110 +/- 4 to 60 +/- 3 mg/dl) but in Group 3 it was maintained at 45 +/- 4 mg/dl by exogenous glucose infusion at a rate of 2.2 +/- 0.4 mg/kg.min.
 Hepatic glucose production increased 50 +/- 13%, 127 +/- 30%, and 55 +/- 30% in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, within 60 minutes and was 56 +/- 19%, 55 +/- 17%, and -0.04 +/- 12% during the last hour of the experiment.
 Glucose utilization did not change in Groups 1 and 2 but it increased in Group 3.
 Plasma lactate increased in Group 1 (from 850 +/- 190 to 1,980 +/- 450 mumol/L) and in Group 2 (985 +/- 180 to 4,785 +/- 500 mumol/L), while in Group 3 there was an early rise (to 695 +/- 120 mumol/L) within 30 minutes that gradually dropped to near basal.
