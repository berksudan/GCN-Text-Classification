Effect of captopril on glucose concentration. Possible role of augmented postprandial forearm blood flow.
 The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of captopril on plasma glucose concentration.
 The daily profiles of the plasma glucose levels were determined in 12 non-insulin-dependent diabetic normotensive subjects, treated with or without captopril at a dose of 25 mg 3 times/day.
 Forearm blood flow was also measured by strain-gauge plethysmography.
 Administration of captopril improved the daily profile of the plasma glucose level.
 Postprandial forearm blood flow was also augmented 2 h after a meal.
 These results suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may improve glucose metabolism in diabetic subjects, possibly through enhancement of blood flow to skeletal muscle.
