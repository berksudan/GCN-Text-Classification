Abnormal arginine vasopressin response to cigarette smoking and metoclopramide (but not to insulin-induced hypoglycemia) in elderly subjects.
 Aging is known to reduce arginine vasopressin (AVP) response to volumetric stimulations and to increase AVP responses to osmotic stimuli and to administration of metoclopramide (MCP).
 In order to gain a better insight into the effect of age on AVP secretion, we evaluated AVP responses to cigarette smoking, MCP, and insulin-induced hypoglycemia in 30 male subjects aged 22-81 and divided into 3 groups by age.
 Basal AVP concentrations were similar in all groups.
 The AVP response during the insulin tolerance test had a similar pattern and magnitude (2.5-fold increase) in all groups.
 AVP responses to MCP and cigarette smoking were similar in the two younger groups, with plasma AVP levels increased 2 times by MCP and 2.5 times by cigarette smoking.
 In contrast, both MCP- and cigarette smoking-induced AVP rises were significantly higher in the oldest group, where plasma AVP concentrations increased 2.5 times after MCP and 3.25 times after smoking.
 When data of the MCP and cigarette smoking tests were combined, regression analyses showed a significant positive correlation between AVP peak responses to MCP and cigarette smoking in the oldest subjects.
 These data show that elderly humans have increased AVP responses not only to MCP but also to cigarette smoking, suggesting a common disorder for both alterations.
 In contrast, the lack of age-related changes in AVP response during the insulin tolerance test demonstrates that the mechanism underlying the AVP response to hypoglycemia is not affected by aging.
