Effect of chronic alcohol administration on transketolase in the brain and the liver of rats.
 To estimate the nutritional and the pathological states in thiamin-deficiency-related diseases, especially Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, we studied the relationship among transketolase activity, transketolase concentration, and thiamin phosphate esters in rats chronically fed alcohol.
 In the brain of alcohol-fed rats, the enzyme activity and concentration decreased although there was no positive correlation between the two.
 On the contrary, transketolase activity in the liver correlated positively with concentration, and both transketolase activity and concentration were decreased in the thiamin-deficient groups.
 These findings suggest that transketolase in the brain may be different from that in the liver and that the alteration of the enzyme activity in the brain may be based on the conformational change of the protein molecule caused by chronic alcohol administration.
