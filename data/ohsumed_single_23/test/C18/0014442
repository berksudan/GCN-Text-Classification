Metabolic alterations following continent urinary diversion through colonic segments.
 This study examined acid-base metabolism in patients with continent colonic urinary diversions and compared them to a control population.
 Diverted patients demonstrated mild acidosis and a urinary acidification defect.
 Ammonium chloride loading failed to demonstrate any major differences in the ability of these patients to handle an acute acid challenge.
 Continent colonic urinary diversions do not appear to create significant acid-base changes in patients with normal hepatic and renal function.
