The relationship between clinically confirmed cobalamin deficiency and serum methylmalonic acid.
 Over a 1-year period, we examined 42 consecutive patients with low serum cobalamin levels detected by primary screening test (S-protein binder, RIA).
 In 31 patients (74%) clinical cobalamin deficiency was confirmed, whereas the remaining 11 patients (26%) were characterized clinically as non-cobalamin deficient.
 The serum methylmalonic acid level was higher than 0.34 mumol l-1 (3 SD above the mean in normal controls) in 30 of the 31 clinically characterized cobalamin-deficient subjects, and below this level in 10 of the 11 non-deficient patients.
 We conclude that the serum methylmalonic acid assay provides an appropriate means of discrimination between cobalamin deficiency and non-cobalamin deficiency (efficiency = 0.95), and we recommend that the assay be adopted as the standard test for diagnosis of tissue cobalamin deficiency.
