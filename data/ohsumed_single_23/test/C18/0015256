Cerebrospinal fluid losses through ventricular catheters leading to hyponatremia in two children.
 I have presented two cases of patients with hyponatremia due to excessive cerebrospinal fluid losses from ventricular drains.
 The possibility of such losses exists whether the drain is used to treat hydrocephalus or to monitor intracranial pressure.
 I find normal saline (sodium concentration = 154 mEq/L) to be an appropriate fluid to replace ongoing losses of cerebrospinal fluid from a ventricular drain and currently start such replacement therapy (mL for mL) when the drain is placed.
