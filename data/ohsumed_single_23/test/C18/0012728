Estimates of metabolic rate in obese and nonobese adolescents.
 To evaluate the validity of equations for the calculation of basal metabolic rate, we compared measured metabolic rates in a population that included obese and nonobese adolescents with metabolic rates calculated from five equations commonly used to estimate metabolic rate.
 Of the available options, neither the Mayo Clinic nomogram nor the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization/United Nations University (FAO/WHO/UNU) equations produced estimates that differed significantly from measured values.
 In a second cohort of severely obese adolescent girls, the FAO/WHO/UNU equation that included both height and weight provided the most accurate estimate of metabolic rate.
 Because of their simplicity, we recommend use of the FAO/WHO/UNU equations to estimate metabolic rate in adolescent populations (boys: BMR = 17.5 weight (kg) + 651; girls: BMR = 12.2 weight (kg) + 746).
 However, when obese cohorts are studied, the FAO/WHO/UNU equation that includes both weight and height predicts metabolic rate most accurately (boys: BMR = 16.6 weight (kg) + 77 height (m) + 572; girls: BMR = 7.4 weight (kg) + 482 height (m) + 217).
