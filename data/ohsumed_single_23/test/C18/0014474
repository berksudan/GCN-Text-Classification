Urinary bladder function 6 months after the onset of diabetes in the spontaneously diabetic BB rat.
 Urinary bladder function was examined in the spontaneously diabetic BB rat six months after the onset of diabetes.
 Diabetes caused significant decreases in rat weight and increases in bladder body weights and in vivo bladder capacities compared to age-matched controls, but no changes in the weights of bladder bases.
 The absolute contractile responses of urinary bladder body and base strips to nerve stimulation, carbachol, 5-hydroxytryptamine, ATP, phenylephrine, and KCl were unaltered by diabetes.
 However, when the data were corrected for tissue mass, there were slight but not significant decreases in contractile responses of strips from diabetic rats.
 There were increases in total muscarinic receptor numbers and calcium channel binding sites in bladder bodies from BB rats as a result of the increases in tissue mass.
 The data indicate that the six month-diabetic BB rat differs from the streptozotocin-diabetic rat in the sensitivity of the urinary bladder to the complications of diabetes, probably as a result of the insulin treatment required to keep BB rats alive.
