The immune system in hereditary hemochromatosis: a quantitative and functional assessment of the cellular arm.
 The objective of this investigation was to evaluate certain quantitative and functional characteristics of the effector cells of the cellular arm of the immune system in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) with respect to treatment status.
 Two observations were consistent with the postulate that the elevated levels of storage iron has in vivo immunoregulatory properties: (1) the absolute number of CD8-positive T cells were significantly elevated in untreated HH patients (n = 7) and reduced in treated patients (n = 7), as compared with controls; and (2) the proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from untreated HH patients to mitogens was suboptimal but the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) from treated HH patients was normal.
 Furthermore, immunoglobulin secretion by PBM from treated HH patients as compared to controls was altered.
 Finally, one T effector cell abnormality was unrelated to treatment status in that a subset of mature, non-activated T lymphocytes aberrantly formed thermostable erythrocyte-rosettes (TE-R), a lymphoid surface marker usually expressed on thymocytes or activated T cells.
 Taken together these data define certain immune alterations that are consistent with the interpretation that cellular immunity may be influenced by the high level of storage iron in HH patients.
