Effect of trestatin, an amylase inhibitor, incorporated into bread, on glycemic responses in normal and diabetic patients.
 The effect of incorporating the pancreatic alpha-amylase inhibitor trestatin into bread on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin excursions was tested in healthy volunteers and non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients.
 At both dose levels of trestatin (3 and 6 mg/75 g starch) the peak values of plasma glucose and insulin were reduced markedly (compared with placebo) after the ingestion of 75 g starch in the form of bread.
 In healthy control subjects as well as in diabetic patients, trestatin produced significantly lower insulin excretions but also significant reductions in incremental plasma glucose areas in a dose-dependent fashion.
 It is concluded that it is technologically feasible to incorporate trestatin into starchy foods without loss of activity or impairment of taste.
 Furthermore, the positive effect of trestatin on glycemic and insulinemic responses in diabetics and the lack of serious side effects offer a great potential in the dietary treatment of diabetic patients.
