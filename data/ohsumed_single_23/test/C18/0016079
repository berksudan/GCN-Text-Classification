Nutrition management for individuals with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the 1990s: a review by the Diabetes Care and Education dietetic practice group.
 Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), or Type II diabetes, is characterized by two primary defects: insulin resistance and insulin secretion.
 The two major goals of management of NIDDM are to achieve near normal metabolic control and to prevent/delay the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes.
 Nutrition, exercise, and, if necessary, medication are the three primary treatment modalities used in NIDDM.
 Treatment regimens need to be individualized and developed with consideration for diabetes management goals and quality-of-life issues.
 Lean individuals with NIDDM should be encouraged to maintain their body weight and modify food composition and eating pattern to minimize glucose excursions.
 The primary treatment goal for an obese individual with NIDDM is weight loss.
 The process of teaching nutrition and meal planning involves developing a cooperative alliance, gathering information, setting realistic goals, intervention, and maintaining change.
 Nutrition intervention involves providing information in stages, beginning with "survival skill" information and progressing to in-depth information.
 The dietitian's responsibility is to promote continuity of learning by introducing new ideas and concepts and altering the learning environment.
 Dietitians can expand their role in the 1990s to that of a diabetes educator taking a leadership role to ensure that the individual with NIDDM receives comprehensive and individualized care.
