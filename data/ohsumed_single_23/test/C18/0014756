Preprandial blood glucose values and glycemic responses in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus at constant insulinemia.
 The influence of preprandial blood glucose (PPBG) concentration on glycemic responses was studied in seven subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes who, by means of the artificial pancreas, had achieved PPBG concentrations of 6, 9, and 17 mmol/L.
 A test meal of 50 g parboiled rice was given at the three different occasions and a constant insulin infusion was provided during the observation periods.
 The mean postprandial-blood-glucose-response area (above basal) differed significantly at the three blood glucose concentrations of 6, 9, and 17 mmol/L, reaching 1371, 621, and 179 mmol/L x 240 min, respectively (P less than 0.01).
 A negative correlation between the PPBG concentrations and the glycemic responses to the test meal was found (r = 0.94; P less than 0.001).
 The fasting insulin concentration at a PPBG concentration of 17 mmol/L was lower than at a PPBG concentration of 6 and 9 mmol/L.
 In conclusion, the glycemic responses to a carbohydrate meal are inversely correlated to the PPBG concentration in insulin-dependent diabetic subjects.
