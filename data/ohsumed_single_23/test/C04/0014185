Cutaneous angiolipoleiomyoma.
 We describe eight cases of cutaneous angiolipoleiomyoma, a rare tumor previously reported only once under the term cutaneous angiomyolipoma.
 Clinically, the tumors were acquired, solitary, asymptomatic nodules that were always acral in location.
 Patients' ages ranged from 33 to 77 years (median 52.6 years); the male/female ratio was 7:1.
 Signs of tuberous sclerosis or renal angiomyolipoma were absent in all cases.
 Histologically, the tumors were subcutaneous, well circumscribed, and composed of smooth muscle, vascular spaces, connective tissue, and mature fat.
 In some tumors the fat was the predominant component, and in others smooth muscle predominated.
 Elastic tissue stains revealed that some blood vessels had developed an elastic lamina whereas other blood vessels lacked it.
 Additional histologic features occasionally observed included vascular thrombi, glomus bodies, and focal mucin deposition.
