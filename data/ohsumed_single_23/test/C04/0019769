Titrated intravenous barbiturates in the control of symptoms in patients with terminal cancer.
 Patients with terminal cancer may have a series of severe and dehumanizing physical and psychologic symptoms.
 To improve symptom control in the final days and hours of life, we administer intravenous barbiturates continuously to provide heavy sedation or continuous somnolence.
 Titrated dosage is then reduced to a minimum, after a desired steady-state has been achieved.
 Improved symptom control is provided, and the patient's dignity is maintained until death.
