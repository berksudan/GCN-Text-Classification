Progress in psychosocial and behavioral cancer research. The need for enabling strategies.
 A major component of the Second Workshop on Methodology in Behavioral and Psychosocial Cancer Research was a discussion of enabling strategies, that is, strategies by which future goals and needs in the area of psychosocial and behavioral oncology might be accomplished.
 This report describes and comments on the discussion that took place at a special plenary session at which representatives from four funding agencies, the American Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Mental Health, and National Science Foundation, presented their views and their agencies' programs for promoting research in psychosocial and behavioral oncology.
 It is concluded that much progress has been made in the field and that strategies are in place for ensuring continued progress.
 However, suggestions are also made for new strategies that might accelerate and broaden that progress.
