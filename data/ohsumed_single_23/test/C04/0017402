Disposition of cerebral metastases from malignant melanoma: implications for radiosurgery 
 Radiosurgery is becoming more generally available and indications for its use continue to be defined.
 Cerebral metastases from malignant melanoma are often treated with whole-brain irradiation, but with limited benefit.
 Innovative treatments, such as radiosurgery, make possible the delivery of doses of radiation that are higher than usual.
 To determine how many patients might be candidates for radiosurgery, a retrospective analysis of computed tomographic brain scans performed on 41 patients with cerebral metastases from malignant melanoma was undertaken.
 One-third of these patients were found to have cerebral metastases amenable to a radiosurgical approach, as illustrated radiation dose-volume histograms.
 Patient and tumor characteristics suggest that this series is represent with cerebral metastases from malignant melanoma.
 The implications of radiosurgery for normal tissue radiation tolerance and its effects on melanoma are discussed.
