Usefulness of epidurally evoked cortical potential monitoring during cervicomedullary glioma surgery.
 This report describes a patient with an intramedullary ependymoma at the region of the cervicomedullary junction in whom there was an abolition of somatosensory evoked potentials following median nerve stimulation.
 During intraoperative monitoring of cortical potentials elicited by epidural cervical cord stimulation, the tumor was removed.
 Posterior epidural stimulation appeared to depolarize more ascending fibers than did stimulation of a single peripheral nerve.
 We recommend that, in cases of operations in this vital area, epidurally evoked cortical potentials be monitored intraoperatively.
