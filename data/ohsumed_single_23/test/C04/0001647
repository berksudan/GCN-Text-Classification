Ovarian metastases are rare in stage I adenocarcinoma of the cervix.
 Over a 32-year period at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center, all cases of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix were reviewed to determine the incidence of ovarian metastases in stage I disease.
 One of 25 patients (4.0%) who underwent an exploratory laparotomy and radical hysterectomy had a microscopic ovarian metastasis.
 A literature review identified nine additional patients who had ovarian metastases and stage I adenocarcinoma of the cervix.
 Including our series, the overall reported rate of ovarian metastases is 1.8%.
 All ten patients had at least one of the following additional characteristics: They were postmenopausal, they had adnexal pathology, or they had positive pelvic lymph nodes.
 Thus, ovarian preservation is warranted in premenopausal patients who do not have ovarian pathology or evidence of other metastatic disease at surgery.
 Bilateral oophorectomy may be performed if frozen-section examination of enlarged or suspicious nodes documents metastases.
 If the ovaries are left in the pelvis at the completion of the surgical procedure and microscopic spread to other pelvic tissues is documented, pelvic irradiation can be administered.
