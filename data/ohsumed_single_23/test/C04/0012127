Hemangioma of the temporalis muscle.
 A rare case of an intramuscular hemangioma of the temporalis muscle is reported.
 The clinical examination, carotid arteriogram, computed tomographic scan, and aspiration cytology suggested the vascular nature of the tumor, but an exact diagnosis could only be made after histopathologic examination.
 Temporary occlusion of the ipsilateral external carotid artery and subperiosteal dissection permitted complete, wide excision without much bleeding.
