Resection of the primary liver cancer of the hepatic hilus.
 Primary liver cancer (PLC) of the hepatic hilus was designated as a tumor situated at the main branch of the portal vein or pedicle of the hepatic veins in contact with the intrahepatic vena cava.
 That is, the main tumor located at segment I, IV, V, or VIII and concentrating on the central part of the liver was called "the central type of PLC," which differed from a tumor located at segment II, III, VI, or VII; the latter was called "the peripheral type of PLC." Surgical treatment of the PLC has been significantly improved in the past two decades, but the resection of the central type of PLC is difficult and hazardous.
 This institution admitted 903 PLC from January 1970 to April 1988, of which 118 cases were the central type; 65 cases were resected successfully, a resectability of 55.1%.
 One patient died from sepsis within 1 month of operation (mortality 1.53%).
 The modes of operation for the different segments are described, and suggestions for improvements are presented.
 The survival rates were compared with a similar number of patients with the peripheral type of tumor in the same period and treated by the same surgeons.
 The results show noticeable differences.
 The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after resection were 70.9%, 43.2%, and 39.2% in the central type of PLC; they were 98.3%, 85.0%, and 76.4% in the peripheral type of PLC (P less than 0.001).
 Further discussion of improvements in surgical techniques and mental awareness are suggested.
