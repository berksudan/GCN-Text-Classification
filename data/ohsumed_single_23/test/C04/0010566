High incidence of antibodies to HTLV-I tax in blood relatives of adult T cell leukemia patients.
 Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is caused by the human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I).
 Although the mechanisms of the leukemogenic process are unknown, the tax gene may have a role in this process.
 Because clustering occurs with HTLV-I and ATL, members of ATL families were examined for antibodies to the tax protein and compared with matched HTLV-I-positive blood donors.
 To investigate the antibody response to this protein, a plasmid, pBHX-4, was constructed to express a recombinant tax protein (r-tax).
 For ATL patients and their HTLV-I antibody-positive blood relatives, the rate of seroreactivity with the r-tax protein was 67.3% (35/52), compared with 51.6% (97/188) for HTLV-I antibody-positive control blood donors (P less than .05).
 The difference between direct offspring of ATL patients and matched HTLV-I blood donors was even greater (84.2% [16/91] vs.
 44.2% [42/95]; P less than .005).
 Thus, tax antibody positivity in direct offspring of ATL patients may reflect differences in time or route of HTLV-I infection.
 Alternatively, it might reflect genetic differences in host susceptibility or virus strain.
