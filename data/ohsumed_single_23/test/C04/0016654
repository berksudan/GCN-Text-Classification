 Serum alpha-fetoprotein screening led to the detection of an endodermal sinus tumor of the ovary in a 24-year-old female in week 17 of pregnancy.
 After surgery, chemotherapy was postponed.
 In week 28 levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein increased, but delivery was delayed until 33 weeks' gestation.
