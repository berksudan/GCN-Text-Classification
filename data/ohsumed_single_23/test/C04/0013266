Social support and the cancer patient. Implications for future research and clinical care.
 This review assesses past progress, current practices, and future needs in research and clinical practice involving the social support needs of cancer patients.
 A review is given of the various conceptualizations of the social support/stress paradigm and of the state of the art of measuring social support.
 Then the current work in the field of social support and cancer is considered and an argument is made for the use of social support measures, which are relevant to the experiences of the cancer patient.
 Potential adaptations of an existing instrument (the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Scale) are demonstrated, and a taxonomy of stages of cancer that would require additional types of social support measures and interventions is outlined.
 Interventions are discussed in terms of the traditional support groups as well as interventions by the oncologist and primary care physician.
 An argument is made for the inclusion of quality of life or functional measures as outcomes in clinical trials and the care of the cancer patient.
 Finally, the need to address the existential, philosophic, or religious issues surrounding cancer and its treatment is discussed.
