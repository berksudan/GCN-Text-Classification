Measurement techniques for melanoma: a statistical comparison 
 Inter- and intra-observer variation in measuring the depth of invasion of malignant melanomas was assessed using three different techniques: eye-piece graticule, stage Vernier, and projection image analysis.
 Significant variation was found for all methods but was least pronounced with the stage Vernier.
 It is recommended that this should be the preferred technique for routine use.
