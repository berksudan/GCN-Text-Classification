Surgical voice restoration with the Blom-Singer prosthesis following laryngopharyngoesophagectomy and pharyngogastric anastomosis.
 Surgical voice restoration using the Blom-Singer technique is a well-established procedure in patients who have undergone simple laryngectomy.
 Operations for hypopharyngeal carcinoma are more extensive and require reconstruction using regional skin or myocutaneous flaps, or reanastomosis with colon, jejunum, or stomach.
 We report the use of the Blom-Singer prosthesis in four patients who had undergone pharyngogastric repair following laryngopharyngoesophagectomy and who had failed to achieve a satisfactory voice.
 All patients initially developed good speech using the prosthesis.
 Two patients subsequently had their prostheses removed: one because of recurrent malignant disease and one because the procedure had not significantly altered the quality of the voice.
 The remaining two patients have continued to use the device at 2 and 5 years after insertion with good voice production.
