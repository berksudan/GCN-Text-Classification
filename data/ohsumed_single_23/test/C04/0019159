Primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring 8 mm in diameter with lymph node metastases. Report of a case.
 Colonic adenocarcinomas measuring less than 10 mm are rare.
 Herein, we report a carcinoma measuring 8 mm in diameter associated with subserosal extension through a "locus minoris resistentiae" and metastases to lymph nodes, an association not previously reported.
 No residual adenomatous tissue was found, suggesting a de novo carcinoma.
