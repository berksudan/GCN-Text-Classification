Lymphoscintigraphy with 123I-labelled epidermal growth factor 
 We have used 123I-labelled epidermal growth factor (EGF) scans to study 14 patients with advanced cervical cancer.
 Abnormal lymph node imaging was seen most clearly 6-8 h after the injection and revealed abnormal uptake by pelvic lymph nodes in 11 patients.
 4 of these 11 had abnormal computerised tomographic and ultrasound scans; in the other 7 conventional radiology did not confirm the presence of disease.
