Myeloma manifesting as a large jugular tumor: case report.
 The authors report a case of cranial plasmacytoma with multiple myelomas and palsy of the lower cranial nerves.
 The osteolytic lesion adjacent to the jugular foramen was demonstrated by an angiogram to be exceedingly hypervascular, with arteriovenous shunting resembling that seen in paragangliomas.
 Forty-five cases of cranial and intracranial plasmacytoma from the literature were reviewed.
 The findings indicate that a cranial plasmacytoma commonly appears to be a hypervascular tumor, whereas most dural tumors or intraparenchymal tumors have poor vascularity.
