Cystic hygroma: massive recurrence in adult life.
 Cystic hygroma is considered a disease of childhood.
 It may appear for the first time in adult life but recurrence by that stage is rare and may present difficulties in diagnosis due to previous treatment.
 The authors present a case where early pharmacological intervention may have prevented a potentially life threatening situation.
 The world literature is also reviewed.
