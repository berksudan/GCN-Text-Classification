Phase I trial of piritrexim capsules using prolonged, low-dose oral administration for the treatment of advanced malignancies.
 A phase I trial of piritrexim was conducted by use of a prolonged, low-dose oral schedule.
 A number of different regimens were tested, including daily dosing for 21 days followed by 7 days of no drug therapy; continuous dosing; and daily dosing for 5 of 7 days for 3 consecutive weeks followed by a week of rest.
 Dose escalation was accomplished by increasing the dosing frequency from once a day to twice a day and then to three times a day and by increasing the number of days of administration.
 Fifty-one patients with advanced cancer were entered in the study.
 One hundred twenty-four (96%) of 129 courses were considered assessable.
 Myelosuppression proved to be the dose-limiting toxic effect.
 Other toxic effects included stomatitis, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, skin rash, fatigue, and elevation of liver transaminase levels.
 Antitumor activity was observed in patients with melanoma and bladder cancer, and disease stabilization occurred in those with sarcoma and pheochromocytoma.
 The recommended dosing schedule for phase II clinical trials is 25 mg three times a day for 5 days for 3 consecutive weeks followed by 1 week of no drug therapy.
