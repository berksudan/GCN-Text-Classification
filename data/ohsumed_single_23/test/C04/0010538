Interferon alpha and etretinate combination treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
 Eleven patients suffering from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) were treated with recombinant interferon alpha-2A in combination (seven patients) or alone.
 Two patients, one in combined treatment, went into clinical complete remission, and five experienced partial remission.
 Two patients progressed during therapy, and two were nonevaluable because they stopped treatment early due to side effects.
 Dosages of interferon were from 3 to 36 million units daily for 3 months, and thereafter 3 times weekly.
 Etretinate (0.7 mg/kg) was given orally.
 The study showed that recombinant interferon alpha-2A in combination with etretinate or alone can induce remission of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
