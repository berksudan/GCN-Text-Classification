Detection of residual leukemia after bone marrow transplant for chronic myeloid leukemia: role of polymerase chain reaction in predicting relapse.
 We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect residual leukemia-specific mRNA in blood and marrow from 37 patients in complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission after allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
 Our two-step PCR method involved the use of "nested primers" in the second step and could detect one K562 cell diluted into 10(5) normal cells.
 Elaborate measures were taken to exclude false-positive and false-negative results.
 In nine patients whose blood and marrow were studied simultaneously the results were concordant (two positive and seven negative).
 Twenty-three patients transplanted in chronic phase (CP) with unmanipulated donor marrow were studied.
 Blood cells from nine of these patients were studied 3 to 6 months post-BMT and six were PCR positive; three were negative on subsequent studies.
 Blood cells from 18 patients studied between 8 months and 8 years post-BMT were all PCR negative.
 Nine patients transplanted in CP with T-cell-depleted marrow cells were studied.
 Blood from five was positive 3 to 24 months post-BMT; blood from five was negative 3 to 6 years post-BMT.
 Four patients no longer in first CP were studied after BMT with unmanipulated donor marrow.
 Blood from all four was positive 5 to 19 months post-BMT.
 Based on the known clinical results of transplant in these three cohorts we conclude that PCR may be positive within 6 months of BMT in patients who can expect long-lasting remission, whereas PCR positivity later after BMT may indicate that the probability of cure is reduced.
 Thus, the technique may prove useful for early assessment of new transplant protocols that might inadvertently increase the risk of relapse.
