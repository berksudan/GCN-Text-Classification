Rectus abdominis muscle flap with microvascular anastomoses for repair of recurrent sarcoma.
 After radical resection of a recurrent leiomyosarcoma, the thoracic wall was stabilized with a Gore-Tex graft.
 The skin and soft tissue defect was repaired with a large rectus abdominis flap in which the circulation was secured by end-to-end microvascular anastomosis of the inferior epigastric artery to the internal mammary artery, which had to be cut during tumor removal.
