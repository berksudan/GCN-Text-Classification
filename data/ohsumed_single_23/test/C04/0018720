Spinal glioblastomas: report of seven cases and review of the literature.
 Intramedullary glioblastomas are uncommon tumors.
 They occur chiefly in the cervicothoracic segments, have a slight tendency to occur in the early decades of life, and have a short clinical history before diagnosis.
 We report seven cases and discuss the salient features of these tumors, particularly the pathological features and treatment, in light of the relevant literature.
