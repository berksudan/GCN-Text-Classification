Salivary flow rates in patients with head and neck cancer 0.5 to 25 years after radiotherapy.
 In this clinical study at the University of Texas M.
 D.
 Anderson Cancer Center, unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates were obtained from 47 patients with head and neck cancer who had received mantle, unilateral facial, or bilateral facial field radiotherapy from 0.5 to 25 years earlier.
 The magnitude of salivary flow rate reduction compared with a healthy control group was primarily related to the radiation dosage and the amount of salivary gland tissue included in the irradiated fields.
 Flow rates were lower for women in all groups, but these differences were not statistically significant.
