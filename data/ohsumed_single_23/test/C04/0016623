Intrahepatic lymphatics opacified during hepatic arteriography in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma.
 Extrahepatic lymph node metastases are not uncommon in advanced cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 This is the account of a HCC case in which intrahepatic lymphatics running toward the hepatic hilus were clearly opacified during hepatic arteriography.
 The patient was treated by hepatic artery embolization followed by selective embolization of the portal branches, but lymph node metastases at the hepatic hilus were later found during follow-up.
 The clinical course of this case suggests that the communication between the tumor and the lymphatics was responsible for the lymph node metastasis.
