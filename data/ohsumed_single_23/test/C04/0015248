 We have presented a case of paratesticular myxoma and have described the clinical history, findings on light microscopy and immunohistochemistry, and possible pathogenesis.
 Although primary paratesticular myxoma is a rare lesion, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intrascrotal mesenchymal tumors.
