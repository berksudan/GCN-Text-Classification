Carcinoma of the ductus choledochus.
 A retrospective review of patients treated for carcinoma of the common bile duct has demonstrated improvement in diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier management by resectional therapy.
 The ability to resect these tumors is directly translatable to improved long-term survival.
 Efforts to obtain proof of malignancy prior to resection are often frustrated by the inability to obtain adequate representative tissue for frozen section.
 Choledochoscopic biopsies and incisional biopsies have given the highest yield of positive diagnoses.
 In experienced hands, a program of fewer preoperative tests with emphasis on early operation, diagnosis, and definitive treatment may be more cost-effective in the management of patients with common bile duct cancer.
