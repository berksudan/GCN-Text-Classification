Sphincter preservation in rectal cancer by local excision and postoperative radiation therapy.
 The authors report the preliminary results of 14 patients with localized, mobile, resectable rectal cancer treated with local excision and postoperative radiation therapy (RT).
 All had negative surgical resection margins and two received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
 The median follow-up was 29 months (4-43 months).
 The 3-year actuarial survival was 88%.
 The incidence of local failure was 7% (only site of failure) and 21% (component of failure).
 The incidence of local failure increased with T stage (T1, 0/3 [0%]; T2, 1/7 [14%]; and T3, 2/4 [50%]) and tumor size (greater than 3 cm, 33%, versus less than or equal to 3 cm, 0%).
 Three patients developed local failure at 6, 15, and 21 months.
 Three underwent a salvage abdominoperineal resection and were locally controlled at 2 and 28 months following salvage surgery.
 One patient underwent an abdominoperineal resection for a clinically presumed local failure; however, no tumor was found in the specimen.
 Therefore, the 13 patients who either were initially locally controlled or underwent salvage or nonsalvage surgery had no evidence of disease in the pelvis at the time of last follow-up.
 Local excision and postoperative RT may be an alternative to standard surgery in selected cases.
 However, additional follow-up and more experience are needed in order to determine if this approach will ultimately have local control and survival rates similar to those of a low anterior resection or an abdominoperineal resection.
