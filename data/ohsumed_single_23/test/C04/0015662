Imaging of adult central nervous system primary malignant gliomas. Staging and follow-up.
 A classification and staging system for primary adult gliomas was proposed.
 This system uses the high signal intensity found on proton density or T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) scans at the site of the tumor and surrounding edema (including infiltrating tumor).
