Laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy in the staging of early carcinoma of the cervix.
 Laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 39 patients.
 An incision of the peritoneum between the round and infundibulo-pelvic ligament on each side gave access to the retroperitoneal space.
 Subsequently, laparoscopic surgery allowed precise dissection of external and internal iliac vessels, umbilical artery, and obturator nerve.
 The peritoneum was left open, and the lymph was drained into the peritoneal cavity.
 No lymphocele was observed.
 Three to 22 (mean, 8.7) nodes were removed, and there was no significant morbidity.
 Sensitivity and specificity were 100% in this preliminary experience.
 It is thus possible to remove the first-line regional lymph nodes of the cervix for pathologic examination.
 Because "skip" metastases are quite rare in early cervical carcinoma, the risk of missing a positive node is low.
 Brachytherapy alone, vaginal surgery, or, in microinvasive carcinoma, conization alone can be applied safely without the need of a staging laparotomy in cases with negative nodes.
