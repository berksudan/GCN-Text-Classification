Indium-111-antimyosin scintigraphy after doxorubicin therapy in patients with advanced breast cancer 
 Indium-111-antimyosin (111In-antimyosin) scans were performed in 20 women with advanced breast cancer after 10 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin (total cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 500 mg/m2).
 Antimyosin uptake in the myocardium was quantified by means of a heart-to-lung ratio (HLR).
 Antimyosin uptake in the myocardium was observed in 17/20 (85%) patients, and HLR after chemotherapy was 1.86 +/- 0.25.
 Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was determined before and after chemotherapy.
 Patients with decreased EF (8/20, 40%) presented with more intense antimyosin uptake (HLR of 2.11 +/- 0.10 versus 1.70 +/- 0.16 (p = 0.01].
 HLR values correlated with EF values after chemotherapy (r = -0.47, p less than 0.05).
 Positive antimyosin studies after chemotherapy including doxorubicin, indicate the presence of myocardial damage in these patients.
 Antimyosin studies are a sensitive method to detect myocyte damage in patients after doxorubicin therapy.
