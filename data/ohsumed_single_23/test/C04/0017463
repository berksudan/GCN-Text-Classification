Epithelial tumors of the ovary: CT findings and correlation with US.
 One hundred thirty patients with 170 epithelial ovarian tumors were prospectively studied with computed tomography (CT) before surgery.
 Ultrasound (US) was performed in 108 patients with 138 tumors.
 At pathologic examination, 78 tumors (46%) were benign, 14 (8%) borderline, and 78 (46%) malignant.
 CT results were compared with surgical and pathologic findings in all patients.
 CT enabled detection of 148 of 170 tumors (87%), and US enabled detection of 118 of 138 tumors (86%).
 Benign serous cystadenomas (n = 42) were correctly characterized with a sensitivity of 69% at CT and 70% at US.
 Benign mucinous cystadenomas (n = 21) were correctly characterized with a sensitivity of 62% at CT and 50% at US.
 Malignancy was suggested in nine of 14 patients (64%) with borderline tumors at CT and in five of 14 (36%) at US.
 The overall accuracy of characterization of benign versus malignant tumors (including borderline tumors) was 94% with CT and 80% with US.
 In the 108 patients studied with both CT and US, the sensitivity of CT was significantly superior to that of US (P less than .03), whereas there was no significant difference in specificity (P = .125).
