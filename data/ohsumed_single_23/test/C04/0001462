Adrenal carcinosarcoma.
 The clinical and pathologic features of a case of adrenal carcinosarcoma are reported.
 Although synchronous malignancy of the adrenal gland has been described, no case of an adrenal tumor combining both carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements has been previously documented.
 This neoplasm is extremely aggressive with distant metastasis arising from the sarcomatous component, and rapid progression despite multimodal therapy.
