Pharyngeal adenocarcinoma with intestinal features.
 A high grade adenocarcinoma arising primarily in the pharynx of a 67-year-old man is presented.
 A CT-scan revealed a tumour mass growing in the pharynx, largely affecting parapharyngeal soft tissues.
 Lymph node metastases were found at clinical presentation.
 Both morphological and immunohistochemical studies displayed similar features to those of intestinal origin.
 To our knowledge, no previous examples of such neoplasm have been reported at this site.
 Its possible histogenetical origin is discussed.
