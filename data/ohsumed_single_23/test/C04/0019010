Vaginal epithelial abnormalities in patients with CIN: clinical and pathological features and management.
 Of 4147 women who had CIN treated by laser at the Regional Gynaecological Oncology Centre, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, 103 (2.5%) had co-existing vaginal epithelial abnormalities.
 CIN 3 was the histological diagnosis most often associated with vaginal lesions.
 The upper vagina was almost always involved.
 In 67% the lesion in the cervix appeared to be confluent with that in the vagina.
 Even when the lesions were confluent, biopsies form the cervical and vaginal components did not always show the same grade of intraepithelial neoplasia and in some biopsies they showed different lesions.
 Laser treatment appears to be effective for the vaginal lesions and is therefore recommended although, in selected patients, careful follow up alone may suffice.
