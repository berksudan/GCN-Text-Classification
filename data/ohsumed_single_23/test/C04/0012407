Second cancer after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix.
 Radiation-induced cancers after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix were investigated on 11,855 patients including 5725 patients treated with radiation therapy alone, 1969 postoperative radiation therapy and 4161 surgery alone.
 The observed-to-expected ratios of the second primary cancer was 0.933 for the patients with radiation therapy alone and 1.074 for the patients with postoperative radiation therapy, respectively.
 No significant increase was observed in the risk of second primary cancers when all sites were combined.
 However, assessing on site by site basis, significant excess was noted for the rectum cancer, leukemia, and bladder cancer for the radiation therapy group but not for the surgery group.
 A significant excess of lung cancer was observed in both radiation therapy and surgery groups, which was attributed to some other causative factors.
 Radiation-induced cancers were suggested to develop apparently in organs involved in the irradiated field.
