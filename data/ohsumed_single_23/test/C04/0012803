Bilateral malignant phyllodes tumours.
 We report a rare example of bilateral primary malignant phyllodes tumours.
 The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a benign epithelial element in each lesion.
 The case illustrates the typical dimorphic features of malignant phyllodes tumours.
 A contralateral tumour should not be regarded as metastatic without histological confirmation.
