Photodynamic therapy to treat tumors of the extrahepatic biliary ducts. A case report.
 The poor survival rate of patients with extrahepatic bile duct tumors is well documented.
 Over the course of 4 years, we treated a white woman with diabetes diagnosed with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the common bile duct with six injections of dihematoporphyrin ether followed by seven photodynamic therapy treatments to the biliary duct.
 As of July 1989, the patient was still alive, was not jaundiced, and had a Karnofsky performance status of 70.
 No changes occurred in any blood chemistry value from the time of injection to the time of photodynamic therapy.
 Of the transient elevations of some blood chemistry values and the white blood cell count, which occurred within 24 to 48 hours after photodynamic therapy, only those of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and amylase were significant.
