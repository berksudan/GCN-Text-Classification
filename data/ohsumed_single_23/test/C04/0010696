A novel metalloproteinase gene specifically expressed in stromal cells of breast carcinomas.
 A gene has been identified that is expressed specifically in stromal cells surrounding invasive breast carcinomas.
 On the basis of its sequence, the product of this gene, named stromelysin-3, is a new member of the family of metalloproteinase enzymes which degrade the extracellular matrix.
 The suggestion is that stromelysin-3 is one of the stroma-derived factors that have long been postulated to play an important part in progression of epithelial malignancies.
