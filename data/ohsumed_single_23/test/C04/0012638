Papillary adenocarcinoma of the middle ear.
 A case of papillary adenocarcinoma of the middle ear is presented.
 The patient had an unusually short history of otalgia, aural discharge and facial palsy, and, at presentation the tumour was too large for surgical resection to be a feasible option.
 The management of this rare tumour is discussed and the relevant literature reviewed.
