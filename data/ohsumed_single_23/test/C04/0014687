Reoperation for colorectal carcinoma.
 In the management of the patient with intra-abdominal recurrence of colorectal carcinoma, surgery remains the primary mode of therapy when cure or significant palliation is anticipated.
 Appreciation of the importance of close follow-up after primary resection coupled with improved diagnostic modalities has allowed the surgeon not only to detect earlier recurrence but also to select the patients most likely to benefit from resection of recurrent disease.
 Improved surgical techniques with resultant decreases in the rates of morbidity and mortality have allowed safe hepatic resection of metastatic disease.
 In selected patients, this procedure produces 5-year survival rates approaching 50%.
 Although a clear consensus has not been reached, most studies agree that positive prognostic indicators include absence of extrahepatic disease, a small number of intrahepatic lesions, a low CEA level, and a better Dukes stage of the primary.
 Likewise, in the patient with recurrent disease locally, surgery provides the only means of cure and also plays a significant role in palliation.
 Aggressive resection with generous surgical margins in patients with contained disease may yield 5-year survival rates approaching 35%.
 In patients with unresectable disease and even in those with carcinomatosis, palliation can be obtained by surgical therapy.
 Judgment is necessary in treating these patients both preoperatively and intraoperatively.
 Surgical intervention for obstruction, perforation, or other anatomic or physiological compromise is often indicated and can improve the quality of life of the patient with intra-abdominal recurrence.
