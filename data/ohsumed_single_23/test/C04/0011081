New chemotherapies for ovarian cancer. Systemic and intraperitoneal podophyllotoxins.
 The epipodophyllotoxin derivatives etoposide and teniposide have been evaluated intermittently for possible use in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
 Conflicting studies suggest that variables such as dose and prior treatment have a major influence on outcome.
 Response rates ranged from 0% to 40% in five series with teniposide, and from less than a 10% overall response rate to greater than a 10% complete response rate in nine studies with etoposide.
 One study documented activity with oral etoposide.
 However, because all patients had received various prior chemotherapies, firm conclusions regarding the activity of etoposide could not be drawn.
 These results, and the expectation of synergy with etoposide and cisplatin, led to several studies that combined etoposide with platin compounds by the systemic and intraperitoneal (IP) routes.
 Various studies have used intravenous drug combinations of these agents in both previously treated and untreated patients.
 One study, which used carboplatin instead of cisplatin, reported only seven failures among 26 previously untreated patients.
 Conversely, the prominent toxicities reported by another study were discouraging, and responses did not exceed what might be expected from cisplatin alone.
 Studies of analogous combinations administered IP are ongoing.
 A favorable experience, which was initially reported by the University of California (San Diego group), is being confirmed by other investigators.
 This has prompted the incorporation of etoposide into first-line strategies.
 The pharmacologic advantage of etoposide by the IP route (related to its high protein binding) may provide appropriate dose intensity against IP disease while sparing systemic toxicities.
 Finally, systemic dose intensity with autologous bone marrow support indicates some promise for etoposide in combination with high-dose alkylating drugs.
