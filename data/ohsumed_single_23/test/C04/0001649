Cold-knife and laser conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
 In a 5-year study, 425 women had conization performed for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, II or III.
 Conization was performed only in cases of positive endocervical curettage or when colposcopy was inconclusive.
 In all other cases, local destruction was the operation of choice.
 In the early years of the study, conization was done by the cold-knife method (N = 201), whereas CO2 laser was used in the latter part of the study (N = 224).
 Success and complication rates were the same for the two methods.
 Abnormal cytology after conization was found in a total of 53 cases (12.5%), but a histologic confirmation of residual or recurrent CIN was made in only 27 women (6.4%).
 This corresponds to a success rate of 92% after cold-knife and 95% after laser conization.
 The CIN grading of the residual or recurrent CIN was similar to or less than the CIN diagnosis of the cone.
 Because our success rate was comparable to that of other series with much less strict referral criteria, our policy seems adequate.
