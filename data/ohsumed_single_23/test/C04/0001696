Detection, prevalence, and prognosis of asymptomatic carcinoma of the cervix.
 Between 1979-1986, 82 of 407 patients (20%) treated for infiltrative carcinoma of the cervix were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.
 Sixteen (20%) of these 82 patients had stage IA, 60 (73%) had stage IB, and six (7%) had stage IIA disease.
 Asymptomatic patients represented 16 of 23 (70%) of stage IA, 60 of 196 (31%) of stage IB, and six of 77 (8%) of stage IIA.
 In the Netherlands, population screening for cervical carcinoma is conducted on women aged 35-55 years.
 To examine the prevalence of asymptomatic cervical carcinoma and the way in which it was detected in different age groups, we studied the patients referred to our department.
 Among the patients younger than 35 years with cervical carcinoma, 20 of 70 (29%) were asymptomatic with disease detected by incidental screening, whereas eight of 177 (5%) in the group 55 years or older had been detected by incidental screening.
 In the age category 35-55 years, 54 of 160 (34%) were asymptomatic.
 Patients aged 35-55 years had undergone population screening or incidental screening.
 In the patients 55 years or older, asymptomatic disease was significantly less prevalent than in younger patients.
 Only one of the 66 asymptomatic patients in stage IB or higher suffered tumor recurrence.
 Among symptomatic patients, 25 of 136 (18%) with stage IB and 17 of 71 (24%) with stage IIA had tumor recurrence.
 Despite the favorable prognosis of patients with asymptomatic carcinoma, asymptomatic presentation could not be shown to be a significant prognostic factor, as were tumor diameter and lymph node status.
