Activation and in vitro expansion of tumor-reactive T lymphocytes from lymph nodes draining human primary breast cancers.
 The feasibility of in vitro activation of lymphocytes from the draining lymph nodes (DLN) of breast cancer patients was examined.
 Lymphocytes isolated from 48 DLN from 12 patients were examined for their proliferative responses to rIL-2, autologous tumor cells, or rIL-2 plus tumor cells.
 Three general patterns of cellular responses were observed.
 Cells from some DLN (17%) were unresponsive to any stimuli.
 Lymphocytes from 52% of the DLN responded moderately to rIL-2 alone.
 The combination of rIL-2 and tumor antigen had a synergistic effect on the proliferation of cells from 31% of the DLN assayed.
 Phorbol dibutyrate and ionomycin plus rIL-2 stimulated expansion of DLN lymphocytes by up to 850-fold after 35 days.
 These expanded cell populations, as well as those stimulated with antigen plus rIL-2, were predominantly CD3+ and CD16- cells, varying in proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ subsets.
 Both populations were cytotoxic against autologous tumor, MCF-7, and K562 target cells.
