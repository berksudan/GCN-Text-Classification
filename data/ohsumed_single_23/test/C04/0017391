Long-term follow-up of patients with recurrent malignant gliomas treated with adjuvant adoptive immunotherapy.
 Between August 1986 and October 1987, the Denver Brain Tumor Research Group conducted a clinical trial using autologous human recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2)-activated lymphocytes to treat 20 patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.
 The trial involved surgical resection and/or decompression followed by intracavitary implantation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and autologous stimulated lymphocytes (ASL) along with rIL-2 in a plasma clot.
 One month later, stimulated lymphocytes and rIL-2 were infused through a Rickham reservoir attached to a catheter directed into the tumor bed.
 The LAK cells were rIL-2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 4 days; the ASL were lectin- and rIL-2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 10 days.
 Of the 20 patients treated, 11 were evaluated as a group (mean age, 44 years, range, 15-61 years; mean Karnofsky rating, 69, range, 50-100; mean Decadron dose at entry, 14 mg/d, range, 0-32).
 The average number of lymphocytes implanted was 7.6 x 10(9) (range, 1.9-27.5 x 10(9], together with 1 to 4 x 10(6) U of rIL-2.
 To date, 10 of the 11 patients died, all from recurrent tumor growth.
 The median overall survival time was 63 weeks (range, 36-201; mean, 86).
 The median survival time after immunotherapy was 18 weeks (range, 11-151; mean, 39).
 No significant difference in survival after immunotherapy was found between those patients who had received previous chemotherapy and those who had not.
 The use of steroids or prior chemotherapy did not influence the in vitro generation of ASL or LAK cells.
