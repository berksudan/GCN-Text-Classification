The value of symptom directed evaluation in the surveillance for recurrence of carcinoma of the breast.
 Specific postoperative tests used to diagnose recurrent carcinoma of the breast were evaluated for their ability to have an impact on the over-all course of the disease.
 Sixty-four patients with recurrent or new contralateral primary disease were divided into two groups based on the method of diagnosis.
 Those patients with a new complaint at an interval between scheduled follow-up visits and who went on to have tests to document a recurrence were categorized as interval follow-up.
 Those who were seen at a prearranged regular follow-up period and received tests as recommended by the attending physician or surgeon and had a documented recurrence were classified as routine follow-up.
 Thirteen patients presented with new contralateral primary disease and 51 with metastatic disease (16, bone; 13, lung; 11, local; three, liver, and eight, multiple).
 The median time to discovery of recurrence from the primary treatment was 29 and 28 months for the interval and routine groups, respectively.
 Ninety per cent of the failures occurred by 53 months.
 The survival time after recurrence was significantly greater in those patients diagnosed routinely (p = 0.003).
 However, the over-all survival time (from primary therapy to death) was only significantly improved for the routine group when the contralateral new primary diseases were included (p = 0.009).
 The method of diagnosis of a contralateral primary carcinoma was physical examination and mammogram.
 Strong recommendations for follow-up testing can be limited to mammogram and physical examination.
