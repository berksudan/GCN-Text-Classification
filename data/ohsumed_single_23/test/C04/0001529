Clinical classification and staging for primary malignancies of the maxillary antrum.
 A study of 51 patients with primary malignant maxillary sinus neoplasms was conducted.
 None of the patients had neck nodes and/or metastases, and each had 5-year follow-up.
 The tumors were staged according to the 1983 and 1988 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging systems for maxillary sinus cancers.
 There were 13 early stage (T1, T2) and 38 advanced (T3, T4) tumors in both systems.
 Cox regression analyses of survival curves showed increasingly worse prognoses for advanced tumors in both T-staging systems.
 Further analyses showed a significant difference in survival between T3 and T4 in the 1988, but not in the 1983 system.
 There were no significant differences in survival according to treatment modality or histological type of malignancy.
 We conclude that the 1988 system prognosticates successfully for T-stage (1 to 4) and demonstrates significant improvement in detecting T3 versus T4 differences compared to the 1983 system.
 The 1988 system applies equally for epidermoid cancer and other malignancies of the antrum.
