Characterization of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the rat pancreas.
 Nodules of acinar cells with increased proliferative potential develop in the pancreas of carcinogen-treated rats and in untreated aged rats.
 Large nodules are classed as adenomas.
 Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of nodule cells were compared with normal pancreas and transplantable acinar cell carcinomas by several methods.
 Nuclei of acinar cells from normal pancreas, adenomas, and three carcinomas in situ had normal diploid DNA content as determined by flow cytometry.
 One of two primary carcinomas had a hypodiploid DNA content.
 Two of three transplantable carcinomas were aneuploid with a DNA content in the tetraploid range.
 Explants from nodules and adenomas failed to grow in soft agar, whereas several carcinomas were positive in this assay.
 A primary carcinoma was serially transplanted, but transplantation of nodules or adenomas failed.
 Transfection of DNA from carcinomas in situ yielded a higher frequency of NIH 3T3 transformants than DNA from adenomas.
 DNAs from the transformants did not contain ras sequences.
 These studies indicate that cells from nodules and adenomas have low growth potential and lack critical phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of transformed malignant cells that were present in some primary and transplanted carcinomas.
