The nursing role in limb salvage surgery.
 Limb salvage surgery has proven itself as a valuable option for sarcoma patients.
 The reconstruction options are vast and include metallic implants, allografts, and a combination of both.
 The nursing implications for these patients are unlimited.
 The patient needs to be educated and assessed closely for complications such as infections, nonunion of the allograft, and limited mobility.
 Although the nursing care is more complicated, the rewards with working with these patients are great.
