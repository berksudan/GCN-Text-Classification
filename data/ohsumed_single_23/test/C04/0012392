The interferon system in carcinoma of the cervix. Effect of radiation and chemotherapy.
 Thirteen patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix were studied for parameters of the interferon system compared with 40 age-matched and sex-matched controls.
 All patients had measurable serum interferon levels; controls did not.
 All patients had non-antibody-type interferon-inhibitory activity, and controls had none.
 Interferon-synthesizing potential was higher in controls than in patients.
 After successful radiation and chemotherapy, these parameters normalized in the patients.
 No change was seen in one patient who did not respond to therapy.
