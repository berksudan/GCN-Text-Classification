Neuromesenchymal hamartoma of the small bowel.
 We present the case of a long small bowel stricture with pathological features similar to those described as "neuromuscular and vascular hamartoma," showing in addition extensive fatty submucosal infiltration and fibrous intramural nodules.
 In the controversy about the nature of this disorder, we consider it a separate entity.
 Taking into account that other mesenchymal tissues than the originally described can participate, we propose the alternative term of "neuromesenchymal hamartoma" of the small bowel.
