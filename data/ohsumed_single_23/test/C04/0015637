Complete remission in refractory anaplastic adult Wilms' tumor treated with cisplatin and etoposide.
 A 61-year-old woman underwent a left radical nephrectomy for Stage II anaplastic Wilm's tumor.
 She received no adjuvant therapy.
 One year later computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a mass in the left renal fossa and retroperitoneal adenopathy.
 A CT-guided needle biopsy was nondiagnostic.
 The patient had progressive disease after treatment with dactinomycin, doxorubicin, and vincristine, but achieved a complete response after treatment with cisplatin and etoposide.
 The therapy of Wilms' tumor in adults is discussed.
