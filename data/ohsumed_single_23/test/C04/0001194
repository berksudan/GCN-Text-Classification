N-[18F]fluoroacetyl-D-glucosamine: a potential agent for cancer diagnosis 
 Positron labeled substrates such as sugars, amino acids, and nucleosides have been investigated for the in-vivo evaluation of biochemical processes in cancerous tissue.
 Hexosamines are obligatory structural components of many biologically important macromolecules, including membrane glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharide.
 We evaluated a new synthesized pharmaceutical, N-[18F]fluoroacetyl-D-glucosamine (18F-FAG), which is a structural analog of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
 C3H/HeMsNRS mice bearing spontaneous hepatomas were used for the tissue distribution study.
 At 60 min after injection, high uptakes were found in tumor (5.16, mean value of %dose/g), liver (3.71), and kidney (3.27).
 The tumor uptake of 18F-FAG showed the highest value in all tissue.
 In the PET study, VX-2 carcinoma of the rabbit was clearly visualized.
 Our preliminary results suggest that 18F-FAG has potential as a new agent for tumor imaging.
