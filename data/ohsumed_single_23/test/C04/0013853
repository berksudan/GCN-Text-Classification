Expression of blood group antigens H-2, Le(y), and sialylated-Le(a) in human colorectal carcinoma. An immunohistochemical study using double-labeling techniques.
 In this study, double-labeling immunohistochemistry was used to gain insight into the coexpression or interrelationship between blood group antigens (BGA) that are differentiation antigens in the normal colon, and BGA that are sequential moieties in the same synthetic pathway.
 Paired-wise Sialylated-Le(a)/Le(y) and H-2/Le(y) was studied.
 The Sialylated-Le(a) and Le(y) are synthesized from type 1 and type 2 backbones, respectively.
 In the normal colon, the Le(y) and Sialylated-Le(a) are expressed by cells at the base and surface of the crypt, respectively, representing undifferentiated and differentiated enterocytes.
 The H-2 is considered oncofetal in nature, and is considered to be the immediate precursor in the synthesis of Le(y).
 In individual cancers.
 Sialylated-Lea and Le(y) were detected in different cancer cells within the same malignant glands, separately in different glands, and in different subcellular compartments of the same cell.
 Both H-2 and Le(y) were coexpressed in the same individual cells in 92% of cancers expressing both these BGA.
 In 50% of the cancers, the H-2 and Le(y) also were expressed separately in different malignant glands within individual tumors.
 These findings indicate that, in colorectal cancers, differentiation antigens (Sialylated Le(a) and Le(y)) are expressed by different individual cells within the same malignant gland somewhat, recapitulating the normal colon crypt.
 Antigens of different backbones occasionally may be expressed in the same cells but within different subcellular compartments.
 Precursor accumulation is common in cancers, and antigens in the same synthetic pathway are coexpressed in the same cell.
 The expression of H-2 and Le(y) in different glands (lack of coexpression) may be explained possibly by aberrant synthesis of Le(y) by an alternate pathway.
