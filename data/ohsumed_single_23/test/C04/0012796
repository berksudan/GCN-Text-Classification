Modified anterior compartment resection.
 In the majority of patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the anterior compartment of the thigh, it is possible to preserve a small portion of the quadriceps with intact nerve supply without compromising on the radicality of the procedure or the local control rate.
 The distal one-third of the vastus medialis can usually be spared with a long, slender branch providing its innervation.
 Dissection of the femoral nerve below the inguinal ligament and its branch(es) to an uninvolved area of the quadricepts the farthest from the location of the tumor is essential.
 This modified anterior compartment resection improves dramatically the function of the extremity.
