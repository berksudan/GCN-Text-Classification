Resections and reconstructions for tumors of the distal radius.
 The primary objective in surgical management of the patient with a distal radius tumor is control of the disease.
 Accurate staging and diagnostic methods applied preoperatively will predict not only the amount of resection necessary to obtain adequate tumor margins, but also the amount of remaining bone and soft tissues to assist reconstruction.
 With this information, a method of reconstruction can be chosen that provides the patient optimal long-term function and stability with predictable results and the fewest potential complications.
