New findings in treatment of colon cancer.
 Patients with colon cancer involving regional lymph nodes (stage C disease) have a 5-year survival rate of only 30% to 40%, and the majority die of recurrent disease.
 Recent trials have shown increased survival rates with postoperative use of fluorouracil plus levamisole.
 The authors discuss these findings and the implications on treatment recommendations for stage C colon cancer.
