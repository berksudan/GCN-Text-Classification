A human CD5+ B cell clone that secretes an idiotype-specific high affinity IgM monoclonal antibody.
 We previously demonstrated the occurrence of a naturally arisen human anti-idiotypic B cell clone, that we transformed with EBV (EBV383).
 We show evidence that EBV383 not only expresses the CD5 surface Ag, but also contains the 2.7-kb mRNA transcript encoding this protein.
 In addition, we show the presence of the 3.6-kb mRNA precursor.
 Most Ig produced by CD5+ B cells are polyreactive natural IgM antibodies encoded by unmutated copies of germline VH genes.
 However, in this study we present data demonstrating the monoreactive high affinity character of the anti-idiotypic antibody (mAb383) produced by EBV383.
 These data are in agreement with our previous observations, showing that the VH chain of mAb383 is encoded by an extensive somatically mutated VHV gene in a way that is consistent with an Ag-driven immune response.
 A possible role for this remarkable anti-idiotypic antibody in the maintenance of B cell memory is discussed.
