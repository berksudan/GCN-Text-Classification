Murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody as a potential network antigen for human carcinoembryonic antigen.
 Carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract are not curable by standard therapies.
 Thus, new therapeutic approaches for this disease are needed.
 This study proposes the use of anti-Id mAb as Ag substitutes to induce anti-tumor immunity in gastrointestinal cancer patients.
 Recently, we have generated and characterized one monoclonal anti-Id antibody, designated 3H1 (Ab2), which mimics biologically and antigenically a distinct and specific epitope of the 180,000 m.w.
 carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) primarily expressed in high density by human pancreatic and colonic tumor cells.
 This epitope is unique to CEA and not present on other CEA-related lower m.w.
 members of the Ag family also found on normal tissues.
 The antigenic determinant as defined by the mAb 8019 (Ab1) against which the Ab2, 3H1 was raised, is absent on normal adult tissues by immunoperoxidase staining and haematopoietic cells including granulocytes by flow cytometry analysis.
 Anti-Id (Ab2) 3H1 induced CEA-specific antibodies in mice and rabbits.
 The immune sera from both mice and rabbits competed with Ab1 for binding to the colon carcinoma cell line LS174T and inhibited the binding of radioiodinated Ab1 to Ab2.
 This indicates that anti-anti-Id (Ab3) in mice and rabbits share idiotopes with Ab1 (8019).
 Furthermore, monoclonal Ab3 that bind to CEA have been generated from mice immunized with 3H1.
 The Ab3 (both polyclonal as well as monoclonal) immunoprecipitated the same 180,000 m.w.
 CEA as Ab1 (8019) by Western blotting analysis and showed almost identical immuno-staining patterns as Ab1 on colonic adenocarcinoma tissue sections from several patients.
 Collectively these data suggest that Ab2 3H1 could potentially be used clinically as a network Ag for immunotherapy of patients with CEA positive tumors.
