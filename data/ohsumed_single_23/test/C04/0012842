The axilla: not a no-go zone 
 Many surgeons, particularly in the UK, give inadequate primary treatment to patients with operable breast cancer.
 For spurious reasons they regard axillary clearance as unnecessarily extensive surgery and rely instead upon total mastectomy or tumour excision and node sampling, with or without postoperative radiotherapy.
 But it is now clear that relapse-free and overall survival can be improved by appropriate adjuvant therapy.
 Thus inadequate exploration of the axilla is doubly unjustified.
 Not only is there the obvious risk of failure to remove nodes that contain metastases--so that some patients are deprived of cure by primary treatment--but the extent of tumour spread will be inadequately assessed in many more patients, with the risk that they may not receive appropriate adjuvant treatment.
