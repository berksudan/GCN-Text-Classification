Extracranial metastatic glioblastoma: appearance on thallium-201-chloride/technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT images.
 Sequential thallium-201-chloride and technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained in a patient with extracranial metastatic glioblastoma multiforme.
 Thallium-201 uptake was high (three times the scalp background) in all pathologically confirmed extracranial metastases and moderate (1.6 times scalp background) intracranially, where most biopsy specimens showed gliosis with scattered atypical astrocytes.
 Technetium-99m-HMPAO uptake was decreased intracranially in the right frontal and parietal lobes which had been irradiated.
 It was also decreased in one well-encapsulated scalp lesion and high in another scalp mass with less defined borders.
 Possible mechanisms of tumor uptake of these agents are reviewed.
