Limb reconstruction with vascularized fibular grafts after bone tumor resection.
 Limb-salvage operations are being used with increasing frequency for patients with malignant bone tumors.
 For children, when a biologic reconstruction is desired, the choice is often between conventional and vascularized fibular grafts.
 An experimental study was performed in dogs to compare the two types of fibular grafts for bridging segmental defects in the radius and ulna.
 Twenty-six adult dogs were divided into two groups and studied at intervals of two, three, four, six, and 12 months after transplantation.
 The conventional grafts healed by creeping substitution i.e., they were first partially resorbed before new bone was laid down.
 In contrast, the vascularized fibulae maintained their normal structure and hypertrophied by subperiosteal new bone formation.
 The conventional fibulae eventually hypertrophied but much later than the vascularized grafts.
 The vascularized grafts were stronger at four and six months.
 Between six and 12 months, both grafts remodeled to resemble the size and shape of the forearm bones they were replacing.
 These experimental results have influenced the treatment of patients.
 Vascularized fibular grafts are ideal for diaphyseal defects greater than 10 cm long, especially in very young children, a poorly vascularized bed, or when bone healing is delayed by chemotherapeutic agents.
 To maximize hypertrophy, an external fixator is used to immobilize the graft rather than a plate, which acts as a stress shield.
