The oncologic risks of skin preservation at mastectomy when combined with immediate reconstruction of the breast.
 Most oncologic surgeons agree that removal of the nipple, the areola and any recent scar at the site of the biopsy is necessary during a mastectomy for treatment of carcinoma of the breast.
 There is less agreement about what should be done with the remaining uninvolved mammary skin.
 Its preservation facilitates the performance of immediate reconstruction of the breast and can lead to improved aesthetic results, but many oncologists fear that this practice could lead to an increased incidence of local tumor recurrence.
 To determine if that fear was justified, 87 patients who had undergone unilateral or bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction for treatment of early carcinoma of the breast were studied.
 Preservation of uninvolved skin was used in all instances.
 All patients had a documented follow-up study of 12 months or more; the average follow-up time was 23.1 months.
 One peripheral local recurrence was observed.
 This 1.2 per cent rate of early local recurrence is lower than that reported from several series using modified radical mastectomy without skin preservation or immediate reconstruction, and suggests that skin preservation does not confer additional risks of local recurrence of carcinoma of the breast in properly selected patients.
