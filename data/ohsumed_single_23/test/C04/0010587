The fastigial pressor response. Case report.
 A distinct vasomotor and cardioregulatory response first identified experimentally was elicited intraoperatively in a 6-year-old girl by local mechanical stimulation in the vicinity of the fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum.
 These findings are discussed in the light of current experimental knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the fastigial pressor response.
