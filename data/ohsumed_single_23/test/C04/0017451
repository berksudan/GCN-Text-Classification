Primary CT diagnosis of abdominal masses in a PACS environment 
 Whether the display medium--film versus cathode ray tube (CRT)--affects observer performance during interpretation of computed tomographic (CT) images is an important research issue in these times of implementation and growth of picture archiving and communications systems in radiology.
 The authors performed a multiobserver receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study to determine the performance of radiologists who read abdominal CT studies displayed on film, as well as on a high-resolution workstation (video monitor) that made use of three different display modes.
 A total of 166 examinations were evaluated by eight radiologists, who recorded their ordinal confidence ratings of the demonstration of presence or absence of abdominal masses.
 ROC analysis showed small differences in the confidence ratings assigned by individual readers for the detection and interpretation tasks.
 Results for the group as a whole showed no significant reduction or improvement in observer performance when ratings for any one of the workstation display modes were analyzed.
 The results of this study demonstrate that current CRT display technology is adequate for enabling the primary detection of abdominal masses with CT examinations.
