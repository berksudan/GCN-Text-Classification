Pigmented spindle cell naevus.
 We report 22 cases of pigmented spindle cell naevus (PSCN).
 The usual appearance of these naevi is that of a heavily pigmented papule found mostly on the legs of young patients.
 Histologically, PSCN was characterized by symmetrical proliferation of spindle-shaped pigmented melanocytes grouped in large junctional nests.
 Pagetoid spread of single cells in the overlying epidermis was frequently found.
 In our opinion, PSCN is a distinctive benign acquired melanocytic naevus that in the past has been frequently misdiagnosed as atypical Spitz naevi or malignant melanoma.
