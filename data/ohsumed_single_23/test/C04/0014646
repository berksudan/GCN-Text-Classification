Metastatic melanoma to the facial nerve.
 Isolated metastatic malignant melanoma to the facial nerve has never been reported.
 This presentation illustrates a primary melanoma of the helix of the ear that was treated by excisional biopsy and then wedge resection in 1983.
 The primary melanoma was Clark's level IV and 1.3 mm in thickness.
 In 1985, a facial paresis slowly developed.
 There was no gross evidence of recurrent melanoma in the ear or neck, but CT scan showed a mass in the region of the stylo mastoid foramen.
 A reoperation of the primary site revealed metastatic melanoma in the facial nerve, expanding it to approximately 10 times its normal size.
 A composite resection was done for the melanoma, and the paralyzed face was immediately rehabilitated by a masseter muscle transfer.
 The patient received 6000 rads to this area postoperatively and has remained free of disease to date, having returned to his profession as a dentist.
 A detailed study of all the specimens indicated that this represented a primary metastasis to the facial nerve.
