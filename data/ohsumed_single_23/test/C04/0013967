Glomus tumor of the coccyx. A curable cause of coccygodynia.
 A 30-year-old woman presented with recurrent severe coccygodynia.
 She underwent exploration for a possible pilonidal sinus and was found to have a precoccygeal glomus tumor that also involved bony trabeculae of the coccyx.
 To our knowledge, a glomus tumor involving the coccygeal bone has not been previously documented.
 In view of the relief of this patient's pain following the surgical excision of coccyx and tumor, a causal role is suggested.
