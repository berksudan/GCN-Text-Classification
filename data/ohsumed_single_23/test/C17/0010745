Scar revision and camouflage.
 The successful revision and camouflage of facial scars is as much an art as a science, and the best teacher is continued experience; however, common sense, a broad knowledge of available options, technical ability, and patience are all necessary if one chooses to practice in this challenging field.
 Patients with facial scars are vulnerable in a way that few others are, and it is the responsibility of the facial plastic surgeon to evaluate these patients properly and realistically, to prepare them for a process that may involve multiple procedures, and to see them through this process with all the expertise and compassion possible.
 If this is done, the rewards to the patient and to the surgeon can be immeasurable.
