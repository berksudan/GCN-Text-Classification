Antibodies to denatured type II collagen in rheumatoid arthritis: negative association with IgM rheumatoid factor.
 Serum samples from 129 patients with definite or classic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were assayed by ELISA for antibodies to denatured bovine type II collagen (dII).
 All patients had active disease at the time of serum sampling.
 Anti-dII antibodies were found in 18 (14%) of 129 patients (95% confidence intervals: 8-20%).
 The only clinical or laboratory feature associated with the presence of anti-dII antibodies was seronegativity for IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM RF): 6 (37.5%) of 16 seronegative patients had anti-dII antibodies vs 12 (10.6%) of the 113 seropositive patients (OR = 5, p less than 0.01).
 There were no associations of anti-dII antibodies with age, sex, race, disease activity, disease duration, functional class, or the presence of HLA-DR1, DR4, or DQw3 in these patients.
 Antibodies to type II collagen may have a pathophysiologic role in RA, especially in patients seronegative for RF.
