Rheumatoid arthritis. New developments in treatment.
 If a patient with active rheumatoid arthritis does not obtain significant relief from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, prompt institution of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is recommended.
 If one agent fails, another may be tried.
 At present, hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) sulfate is one of the most widely used and best tolerated.
 Careful follow-up is essential with all DMARDs, however, because toxic effects may be severe and sometimes unpredictable.
