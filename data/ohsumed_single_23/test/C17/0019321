Revised clinical and laboratory criteria for subtypes of inherited epidermolysis bullosa. A consensus report by the Subcommittee on Diagnosis and Classification of the National Epidermolysis Bullosa Registry.
 Inherited epidermolysis bullosa encompasses a number of diseases, with the common finding of blister formation after minor mechanical trauma to the skin.
 In some forms significant, if not eventually fatal, extracutaneous disease activity may occur.
 In recent years application of newer technologies has contributed substantially to an overall understanding of this collection of inherited diseases.
 Concurrently, many new phenotypes have been recognized, in part the result of ongoing prospective patient registries in the United States and abroad.
 Unfortunately, this has resulted in a massive literature that may appear to be confounded by seemingly excessive or arbitrary subdivision of epidermolysis bullosa variants.
 With these concerns in mind a subcommittee was established by the National Epidermolysis Bullosa Registry to summarize the current literature and to make recommendations as to the best clinical and laboratory criteria for the practical diagnosis and subclassification of patients with inherited epidermolysis bullosa.
