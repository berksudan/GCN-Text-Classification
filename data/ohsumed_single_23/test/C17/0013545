Expression of basement membrane proteins and interstitial collagens in dermal papillae of human hair follicles.
 The expression of basement membrane molecules and interstitial collagens in human hair follicle mesenchyme was studied by immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections and of cells cultured from dermal papillae.
 Type I and type III collagens were found in the dermal sheath and in the dermal papilla throughout the hair cycle.
 Laminin and type IV collagen were expressed at the outer root sheath basement membrane and in the extracellular matrix of the dermal papilla of anagen and catagen follicles.
 In telogen follicles, where the volume of the dermal papilla extracellular matrix is much reduced, outline staining of dermal papilla cells for laminin and type IV collagen was still apparent.
 Staining for bullous pemphigoid antigen was also seen at the outer root sheath basement membrane extending to the lower tip of the hair bulb.
 In anagen follicles, there was no staining for bullous pemphigoid antigen at the interface between hair bulb epithelium and the dermal papilla and no staining within the dermal papilla.
 However, linear staining for bullous pemphigoid antigen became continuous around hair follicle epithelium during catagen and telogen.
 Cells cultured from human dermal papillae also stained for interstitial collagens, type IV collagen and laminin.
 However, similar results were obtained when cultured dermal fibroblasts were stained with the same antibodies.
 The expression of basement membrane proteins in human dermal papillae resembles that seen in follicles from other mammalian species and suggests that this is relevant to dermal papilla function.
 Cultured dermal papilla cells express a similar pattern of interstitial collagens and basement membrane proteins to those seen in tissue sections but this finding is not specific to dermal papilla cells.
