Allergic contact dermatitis to two antioxidants in latex gloves: 4,4'-thiobis(6-tert-butyl-meta-cresol) (Lowinox 44S36) and butylhydroxyanisole. Allergen alternatives for glove-allergic patients.
 Allergic contact dermatitis developed on the hands and/or face of two patients after exposure to latex examination gloves.
 Both patients were patch test negative to the usual rubber allergens, but both had a positive patch test reaction to 4,4'-thiobis(6-tert-butyl-m-cresol) (Lowinox 44S36).
 Patient 2 was also patch test positive to butylhydroxyanisole.
 The patients were tested with other gloves, to find gloves that they could safely use.
 Glove manufacturers were queried to ascertain the occurrence of Lowinox 44S36 and butylhydroxyanisole in different brands of latex and vinyl examination gloves.
 A list of gloves and their associated allergens was generated and is provided to assist dermatologists in helping patients choose gloves free of specific allergens.
