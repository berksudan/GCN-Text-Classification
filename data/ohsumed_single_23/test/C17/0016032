Incisional slit grafting.
 Incisional slit grafting, a new and greatly improved technique in hair transplantation, is described.
 Incisional slit grafting utilizes larger numbers of smaller grafts than does traditional punch grafting.
 No tissue is removed from the recipient bed.
 The vascular supply is conserved, resulting in an increased graft yield.
 The clumping and stalking effect associated with traditional round grafting is eliminated largely, and a more natural frontal hairline is achieved.
