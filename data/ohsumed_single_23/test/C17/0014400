Epidermal growth factor receptor of fibroblasts from patients with scleroderma.
 Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) of fibroblasts from 3 patients with scleroderma (progressive systemic sclerosis, PSS) was studied by radioiodinated-EGF binding assay.
 The binding was 60.9 +/- 4.0% of normal fibroblasts, and the Scatchard plots showed a decrease in the affinity for EGF, not in the number of EGF-R.
 PSS fibroblasts expressed higher levels (1.15-2.45-fold) of RNA for the v-erbB (EGF-R gene).
 All-transretinoic acid (retinoid) had little effect on EGF-R, v-erbB gene expression and the proliferation of PSS fibroblasts.
 These data concerning the abnormality in the EGF-R may all constitute a feature of PSS fibroblasts.
