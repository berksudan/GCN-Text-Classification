Newly identified U4/U6 snRNP-binding proteins by serum autoantibodies from a patient with systemic sclerosis.
 We found serum autoantibodies directed against the proteins binding exclusively to U4/U6 of Sm small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) in serum from a patient (MaS) with systemic sclerosis.
 Their specificity, called anti-MaS, is distinct from that of known antibodies against U snRNP.
 The U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA from a 32P-labeled HeLa cell extract and five proteins with Mr 150,000, 120,000, 80,000, 36,000, and 34,000, in addition to Sm core proteins (B, B', D, E, F, and G) from an [35S] methionine-labeled extract, were immunoprecipitated by anti-MaS in isotonic solution.
 However, the Sm core proteins and U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA were separated from the protein-A-Sepharose facilitated MaS immunoprecipitate by incubation in a solution containing 500 mM NaCl.
 In immunoblots, anti-MaS antibodies reacted with one protein of Mr 150,000 from a HeLa cell nuclear extract that was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet.
 The monospecific immunoaffinity purified antibody eluted from the immunoblot band immunoprecipitated U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA and reblotted the protein with Mr 150,000.
 These data indicate that anti-MaS antibodies recognize at least one antigenic protein that binds exclusively to the U4/U6 snRNP.
