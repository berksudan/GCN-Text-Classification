Leukocyte chemoattractant cytokines of the epidermis.
 The constitutive production of interleukin-1 alpha-like material in normal human epidermis, its inflammatory properties, and the mechanism of its inflammatory action are briefly reviewed.
 The isolation of interleukin-8 from psoriatic lesions, its in vitro production, and leukocyte chemoattractant properties are also described.
 Available evidence suggests that interleukins-1 and -8 are inflammatory cytokines of major potential importance in the induction of leukocyte infiltrates in human skin.
