Analysis of IL-1 and TNF-alpha gene expression in human rheumatoid synoviocytes and normal monocytes by in situ hybridization.
 Human IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha mRNA expression was examined in peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) from normal individuals and in primary synoviocytes isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis by Northern blot and in situ hybridization.
 Cells cultured in the presence or absence of LPS were analyzed using in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled sense or antisense RNA probes to determine the relative abundance and the cell type expressing each of the mRNA for these potent inflammatory mediators.
 The results indicated that 72% of the LPS-stimulated PBM expressed detectable levels of IL-1 alpha mRNA, 89% IL-1 beta mRNA, and 10% TNF-alpha transcripts.
 Thus, the majority of activated PBM produced both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta.
 Experiments combining immunofluorescence for IL-1 beta protein with in situ hybridization for TNF-alpha mRNA demonstrated that monocytes expressing TNF-alpha mRNA also produced IL-1 beta.
 Primary synoviocytes from four patients with RA were also examined for the mRNA expression of each cytokine.
 Northern blot analyses of total RNA isolated from 0 to 72 h after LPS- or mock-stimulation showed that IL-1 beta mRNA was the most abundantly expressed, followed by TNF-alpha.
 In situ hybridization revealed that IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha transcripts were detected exclusively in synovial tissue macrophages.
 IL-1 alpha mRNA was not detected in these cultures by either method.
