Limiting dilution analysis of autocytotoxic and autosuppressor T-cells in rheumatoid arthritis.
 Limiting dilution analysis has shown that the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction is regulated by at least two cell populations, the autocytotoxic and the autosuppressor.
 Limiting dilution analysis in nine patients with rheumatoid arthritis has shown that there is a significant decrease in both populations when compared to 10 control subjects.
 The mechanism and the consequences of this decrease are not known.
