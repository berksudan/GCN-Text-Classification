Administration of folinic acid after low dose methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
 Folinic acid (leucovorin) supplementation has been suggested as a possible means of treating the short term side effects that occur with low dose methotrexate (MTX).
 However, it has not been established whether leucovorin will abrogate the antiarthritic effect of MTX.
 We entered 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with MTX into a 48 week randomized, double blind, crossover trial of folinic acid vs placebo.
 The dose of folinic acid was equal to the dose of MTX and it was given orally 4 h following the single, weekly MTX administration.
 Under these conditions, leucovorin did not decrease the therapeutic effect of MTX.
 While the incidence of stomatitis and gastrointestinal toxicity were lower during leucovorin treatment, our study lacked sufficient power to establish a statistically significant difference.
