Intralesional bleomycin sulfate therapy for warts. A novel bifurcated needle puncture technique.
 A multiple puncture technique using a bifurcated vaccination needle to introduce bleomycin sulfate (1 U/mL sterile saline solution) into warts resulted in elimination of 92% of a random series of 258 warts after a single treatment.
 Recurrence was not observed during a 6-month follow-up period.
 Six of the 66 patients required two to seven treatments for wart eradication, and four patients requested alternative therapy after initial failure with a single bleomycin treatment.
