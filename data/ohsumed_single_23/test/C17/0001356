Pulsed suppressive treatment in rheumatoid arthritis: intravenous methylprednisolone and nitrogen mustard.
 Persistent polyarticular rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and aggressive disease flares resistant to conventional therapy can effectively be controlled by intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (IVMP) or nitrogen mustard (HN2).
 The efficacy, toxicity and immunologic effects of each agent are reviewed.
 Clinical response is evident within days of the start of therapy for both; persisting up to 6 weeks for IVMP and at least 59 days for HN2.
 Morbidity from both agents is minimal when appropriate precautions are taken.
 No mortalities directly related to either modality have been reported in RA.
