The innermost cell layer of the outer root sheath is positive with Ki-67.
 The expression of a cell proliferation-associated human nuclear antigen was immunohistochemically studied in human anagen hair and hair follicles using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67.
 The reaction of Ki-67 in mature anagen hair follicles was observed in the hair matrix cells and outer root sheath (ORS) cells.
 Nuclear staining was seen in a small number of matrix cells and in some ORS cells; this finding corresponded to the thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine labeling studies previously reported.
 In addition, there were two different patterns of cytoplasmic staining in the ORS: strong staining of the innermost cells (IMC) and weaker staining of the other ORS cells in the isthmus.
 Ki-67 reactivity of the IMC layer was observed at each stage of anagen and was regularly seen from the upper bulb to the isthmus.
 Ki-67 is a commercially available antibody that detects cycling cells.
 However, the IMCs in anagen hair follicles showed cytoplasmic labeling by Ki-67 from the matrix cells in the upper bulb to the distal portion of the isthmus.
