Erythema elevatum diutinum mimicking porphyria cutanea tarda.
 A case of erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) closely resembling porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is reported.
 The initial skin biopsies were suggestive for PCT but porphyrin levels in the urine, stool and plasma were normal.
 A further biopsy from an early cutaneous lesion showed a leucocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls.
