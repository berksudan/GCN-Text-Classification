Reports of erythematous macular skin eruptions associated with diltiazem therapy.
 Diltiazem is a commonly prescribed calcium-channel antagonist for hypertension and ischemic heart disease.
 The incidence of rash associated with diltiazem therapy is reported to be 1.3 percent.
 We describe two patients who developed erythematous, macular skin eruptions, approximately two weeks following institution of diltiazem.
 The skin eruptions resolved after symptomatic treatment and the patients received further therapy with another calcium-channel antagonist.
 Diltiazem-associated skin eruptions are a rare adverse effect; however, the incidence of rash may occur more frequently than reported in postmarketing surveillance studies.
