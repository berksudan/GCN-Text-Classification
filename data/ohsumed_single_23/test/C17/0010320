Anogenital warts in children. Clinical and virologic evaluation for sexual abuse 
 Seventy-three children with anogenital warts were examined for sexual abuse during a 2-year period.
 Our data suggest that nonsexual transmission is common, particularly in children under 3 years of age.
 Approximately 25% of these children were younger than age 1 year, and another 50% were between the ages of 1 and 3 years.
 No evidence of sexual abuse was detected in 66 children.
