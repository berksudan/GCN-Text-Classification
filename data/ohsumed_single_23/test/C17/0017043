Patch and prick test study of 593 healthy subjects.
 593 recruits selected by the Military Health Service as being healthy and without a history of present or previous dermatitis, or ocular refraction defects, were patch tested with the GIRDCA (Italian Research Group on Contact and Environmental Dermatitis) standard series.
 Of these, 336 were also patch tested with substances used in the processing and dyeing of textiles and prick tested with 8 major allergens.
 74 (12.5%) reacted to 1 or more substances.
 The most frequent sensitizers were: thimerosal (28 cases), ammoniated mercury (7 cases), phenol-formaldehyde resin (6 cases), parabens, nickel and Disperse Red 17 (4 cases each).
 113 recruits reacted to 1 or more prick test allergens.
 We have demonstrated the importance of establishing such reference values in healthy groups for the correct evaluation of data collected from selected groups.
