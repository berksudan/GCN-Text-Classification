A case of sideburn reconstruction using a temporoparieto-occipital island flap.
 A preliminary case is reported in which a large temporal bald scar including the sideburn was successfully reconstructed using a temporoparieto-occipital island flap in combination with a tissue expander.
 This flap is considered to be a kind of reverse-flow island flap of the occipital artery by means of the fine vascular connections with the temporal branch of the superficial temporal artery.
 This new method is potentially a good solution for sideburn reconstruction.
