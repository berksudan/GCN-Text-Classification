Management of patients and side effects during cyclosporine therapy for cutaneous disorders.
 Cyclosporine has been used in the experimental treatment of multiple inflammatory diseases of presumed autoimmune origin, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, uveitis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, Graves' disease, and myasthenia gravis.
 In dermatology, the drug has been used successfully as primary therapy for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, alopecia areata, pyoderma gangrenosum, Behcet's disease, atopic dermatitis, and lichen planus.
 At a dose of 3 to 5 mg/kg per day, cyclosporine is well tolerated by most patients.
 However, because of concerns about its potential short- and long-term side effects, patients who use this drug require close monitoring.
 This review discusses appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluations, common and unusual side effects and their management, drugs that might alter the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine metabolism, and criteria for dosage adjustments.
