The abraded punch graft for pitted facial scars.
 The abraded punch graft procedure is one in which the surrounding scar area and the graft itself are superficially dermabraded before correction of the defect.
 This alternative procedure has distinct advantages over the standard punch graft and should be considered when contemplating the surgical correction of "ice pick" facial scarring.
 Following the normal reparative process, the abraded punch graft heals with a pleasing aesthetic appearance.
