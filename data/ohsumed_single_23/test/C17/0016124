Regional variation in the expression of pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus erythematosus, and pemphigus vulgaris antigens in human skin.
 The expression of the pemphigus foliaceus (PF), pemphigus erythematosus (PE), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) antigens in 16 different regions of normal human skin was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence by using sera with a high titer of PF, PE, and PV antibodies.
 Regional variations were observed in the expression of all these antigens.
 The expression of the PF and PE antigens, as measured by endpoint titer of antibody reactivity, was highest in skin specimens obtained from the upper torso, and lowest in those from the buccal mucosa, lower torso, and scalp.
 This distribution pattern differed from that of PV antigen, whose expression was highest in buccal mucosa and scalp.
 These patterns correlate with, and may provide a partial explanation for, the different distribution of skin lesions in these different forms of pemphigus.
