Papuloerythroderma. Another case of a new disease.
 We describe a case of papuloerythroderma.
 This is a distinctive clinical entity characterized by pruritus, red-brown flat-topped papules exhibiting the "deck-chair" sign, eosinophilia, and lymphopenia.
 We propose that the Langerhans cell may have a central role in the pathogenesis of papuloerthroderma and we describe an excellent response to photochemotherapy.
