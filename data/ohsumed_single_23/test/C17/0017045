Occupational dermatoses from epoxy resin compounds.
 This study comprises 40 patients with skin disorders from current or previous occupational exposure to epoxy resin compounds (ERC) during 1984-1988.
 ERCs were the 3rd most common cause (32 of 264 cases: 12.1%) of currently relevant allergic contact dermatitis: 23 cases from epoxy resins based on the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA-ERs), 5 from reactive diluents, 1 from amine hardeners (DETA), and 3 from epoxy acrylates.
 2 cases (0.8%) of irritant contact dermatitis were due to ERCs.
 Methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA, an epoxy hardener) caused 1 case of contact urticaria.
 Previously relevant occupational allergic contact dermatitis from DGEBA-ERs was detected in 5 cases.
 On patch testing, ERC allergens gave the following positive reactions: epoxy resin of the standard series in 35 cases (4.0% of 870 tested), epoxy reactive diluents in 10 (7.1% of 140), cycloaliphatic epoxy resins in 4 (11.1% of 36), epoxy acrylates in 4 (4.5% of 88), and amine compounds commonly used as epoxy hardeners in 17.
 Despite extensive patch test series, testing with patients' own ERCs remains important.
