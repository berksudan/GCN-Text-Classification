Treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy by salpingotomy with or without tubal suturing and salpingectomy [published erratum appears in Fertil Steril 1991 Jun;55(6):1213-4]
 Thirty-four women with unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy (EP) were randomly assigned to undergo salpingotomy without tubal suturing (n = 15) or salpingotomy with tubal suturing (n = 19).
 The reproductive performance of these patients was compared with 24 patients who underwent salpingectomy for their EP (historical control).
 Using life table analysis, the cumulative probability of intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) at 12 and 24 months was 45% and 45% after salpingotomy without tubal suturing and 21% and 47% after salpingotomy with tubal suturing, respectively.
 The cumulative probability of IUP after salpingectomy (21% and 26% at 12 and 24 months, respectively) was significantly lower than after salpingotomy with or without tubal suturing.
 There was no difference in the cumulative probability of EP after salpingotomy with or without tubal suturing, but it was significantly higher than after salpingectomy.
 In 18 women who subsequently underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy, no significant difference was found between the degree of adhesions after salpingotomy with or without tubal suturing.
 These findings suggest that IUP after conservative treatment is higher than after salpingectomy, but recurrent EP is also higher.
 Intrauterine pregnancy occurs earlier after salpingotomy without tubal suturing than after salpingotomy with tubal suturing.
 This might be because of rapid return of tubal function after healing by secondary intention.
