Early recourse to laparoscopy in the management of suspected ectopic pregnancy. Accuracy and morbidity.
 Ninety-nine patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy (EP) who were subjected to laparoscopy/laparotomy over an 18-month period at Greenwich District Hospital, London, were audited.
 A third (32/99) of the cases had an EP, and 67 potentially avoidable laparoscopies were performed.
 A potentially avoidable laparoscopy was followed by a laparotomy in 27% of cases (18/67), and at least 13 of those laparotomies were unnecessary.
 In addition, two false-positive diagnoses of EP were made at laparoscopy, resulting in the avoidable loss of part or all of a single remaining fallopian tube.
 With the use of sensitive pregnancy testing at least 62 laparoscopies, 13 laparotomies and 1 case of pulmonary embolus might have been avoided in these patients and up to 195 days' hospitalization saved.
