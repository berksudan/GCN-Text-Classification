Fetal levels of tobramycin following maternal administration.
 A single dose of tobramycin 2 mg/kg was given intravenously to a woman who presented a 22-week heterotopic pregnancy with both intrauterine and ovarian gestations and two living fetuses.
 After excision of the adnexum, tobramycin levels were measured in the maternal serum and in the fetal fluids and tissues.
 Antibiotic levels were especially high in the fetal spleen and kidney.
