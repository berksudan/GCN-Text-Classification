Predictive value of the active renin assay for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.
 The increasing frequency of EP and the need for its early diagnosis have focused our interest on the research of biochemical markers.
 We have established hormonal values in the plasma of 99 spontaneous ongoing pregnancies between the 4th and 10th weeks of amenorrhea, in 21 EPs, and 20 cases of early abortion.
 We have examined the predictive values of trophoblastic and CL production in pathological pregnancies.
 The association of low hCG and low active renin appears to be able to discriminate between ectopic and abortive spontaneous gestations.
