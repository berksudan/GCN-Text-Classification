Ovarian hyperandrogenism: the role of and sensitivity to gonadotropins.
 To determine if ovarian hyperandrogenism represents enhanced gonadotropic stimulation, augmented ovarian sensitivity to gonadotropins, or both, we have undertaken to evaluate (1) the 24-hour integrated concentrations of serum total testosterone (T) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and (2) the ovarian response of T to exogenous gonadotropic stimulation.
 To this end, two groups of women, hyperandrogenic anovulatory (n = 4) and early follicular phase (n = 4) normally-cycling controls, were subjected to continuous blood withdrawal over 24 hours with a portable Cormed pump (Cormed Inc., Middleport, NY) and to exogenous stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin.
 Our current observations support the notion that ovarian hyperandrogenism represents the combined impact of an overall increase in gonadotropic support coupled with augmented ovarian sensitivity to gonadotropic stimulation.
