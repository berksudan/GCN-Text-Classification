Successful treatment of cervical pregnancy with oral etoposide.
 Cervical ectopic pregnancy is an uncommon entity associated with significant morbidity and devastating effects on future fertility.
 A woman with a cervical gestation with quantitative serum beta-hCG levels higher than 46,000 mIU/mL and fetal cardiac activity on ultrasound was treated successfully with one course of oral etoposide, a fetocidal agent, which avoided operative intervention and preserved the patient's fertility.
