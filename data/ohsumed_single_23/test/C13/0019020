External cephalic version at term. A randomized controlled trial using tocolysis 
 OBJECTIVE--To assess the role of external cephalic version (ECV) at term, using tocolysis.
 DESIGN--A randomized controlled trial over a 12 month period.
 SETTING--Harare Maternity Hospital, Harare, Zimbabwe.
 SUBJECTS--208 women with breech presentation at term were recruited after satisfying eligibility criteria.
 There were 103 women in the study group and 105 in the control group.
 At the end of the study a further 104 women were recruited for ECV.
 INTERVENTION--ECV attempted after intravenous injection of 10 micrograms of hexaprenaline, using either forward or backward somersault over a maximum period of 5 min.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Success rate in terms of presentation during labour, need for caesarean section, and various variables related to fetal outcome.
 RESULTS--ECV reduced the frequency of breech presentation during labour from 83% to 17% and that of caesarean section from 33% to 13%.
 There were no troublesome complications from the procedure.
 CONCLUSION--In carefully selected women with breech presentation, ECV at term using tocolysis, safely reduced the rate of breech presentation in labour and also the caesarean section rate.
 Further research is needed to determine the role of ECV in early labour.
