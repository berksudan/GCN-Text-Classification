Preoperative angiographic uterine artery embolization in the management of cervical pregnancy.
 The diagnosis of a cervical ectopic pregnancy is often made intraoperatively in the presence of extensive hemorrhage during attempted evacuation.
 In some cases, hysterectomy has been the necessary treatment to control bleeding.
 We report two cases of cervical pregnancy detected by ultrasound.
 Before pregnancy termination, the uterine arteries were successfully embolized using angiographic techniques.
 As a result, surgical evacuation was performed with minimal hemorrhage; hysterectomy was not required and the patients' potential fertility was retained.
