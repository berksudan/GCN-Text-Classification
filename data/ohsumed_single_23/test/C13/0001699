Experimental and clinical studies with radiofrequency-induced thermal endometrial ablation for functional menorrhagia.
 A method of ablating the endometrium has been introduced into clinical practice that uses radiofrequency electromagnetic energy to heat the endometrium, using a probe inserted through the cervix.
 Preliminary studies suggest that over 80% of patients treated will develop either amenorrhea or a significant reduction in flow.
 The advantages of radiofrequency endometrial ablation over laser ablation or resection are the avoidance of intravascular fluid absorption, simplicity (no special operative hysteroscopic skills are required), speed of operation, and reduced cost compared with the Nd:YAG laser.
 In this paper, we describe the experimental studies performed during development of this new technique.
