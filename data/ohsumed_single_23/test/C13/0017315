Early diagnosis of vulvar neoplasia as a result of vulvar self-examination.
 Vulvar self-examination was used to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of vulvar neoplasia in eight patients.
 Five of them were found to have invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, two had carcinoma in situ, and one had a vulva melanoma.
 All eight patients benefited from early diagnosis, which allowed definitive treatment and vulvar conservation.
