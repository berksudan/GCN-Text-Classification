Antepartum and intrapartum events in women exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol.
 Using a retrospective cohort design, we analyzed the effects of intrauterine diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure on various antepartum and intrapartum events.
 Gravidas exposed to DES had a higher likelihood of being delivered abdominally, undergoing manual removal of the placenta, and hemorrhaging in the postpartum period.
 The increased risk for these events remained after controlling for age, race, and parity.
 We also constructed labor curves in DES-exposed women by plotting cervical dilation against time.
 The curves were similar for nulliparous DES-exposed women and nulliparous controls, but DES-exposed parous women experienced prolonged labors.
 These findings suggest that, in addition to the well-known adverse effects of intrauterine DES exposure, the interaction between the uterus and placenta is altered in some DES-exposed patients.
