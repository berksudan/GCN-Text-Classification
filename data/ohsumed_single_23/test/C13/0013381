Fertility before and after surgery for primary ovarian pregnancy.
 Primary ovarian pregnancy usually occurs in parous fertile women.
 It is an accidental event probably related to the presence of the IUD affecting implantation rather than an indicator of altered fertility.
 Reproductive performance postoperatively remains unmodified.
