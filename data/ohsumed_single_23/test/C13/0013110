Fetal urine output does not influence residual amniotic fluid volume after premature rupture of membranes.
 Fetal urine production in 12 women with premature rupture of membranes did not differ from that of a control group, and there was no correlation between fetal urine output and residual amniotic fluid volume.
 Residual amniotic fluid volume after premature rupture of membranes does not appear to depend on or alter fetal renal function.
