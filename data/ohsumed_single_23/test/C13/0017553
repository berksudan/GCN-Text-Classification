Ascertainment of maternal deaths in New York City.
 Maternal deaths in New York City are defined as deaths from any cause in a woman while pregnant or within six months of pregnancy termination.
 Pilot studies seeking to improve maternal death ascertainment found that selected medical examiner reports contributed an additional 10.5 percent of the total maternal deaths, vital statistics review contributed 6.3 percent, linkage of death tapes of women of reproductive age to live birth and fetal death tapes contributed 1.0 percent.
 Medical examiner cases should be incorporated into surveillance data for accurate ascertainment of pregnancy associated deaths.
