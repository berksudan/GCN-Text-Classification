Premature rupture of membranes at term in nulliparous women: a hazard?
 One hundred five consecutive women with premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) at term were managed expectantly for at least 24 hours.
 Seventy-six went into spontaneous labor, of whom 38 were augmented with oxytocin.
 Twenty-nine had labor induced.
 Subjects who delivered during the same study interval after artificial rupture of the membranes served as controls.
 There were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of amnionitis, endometritis, cystitis, neonatal infection, low Apgar score, low cord arterial blood pH, instrumental delivery, or cesarean delivery.
 Morbidity was seen most often in induced labor whether or not the membranes were ruptured for a long time.
 It is concluded that expectant management of PROM at term does not increase perinatal morbidity.
