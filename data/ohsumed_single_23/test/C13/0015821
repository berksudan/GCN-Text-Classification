Laparoscopic cautery in the treatment of endometriosis-related infertility.
 Life table analysis and the two-parameter exponential method have been applied to pregnancy rates in 72 patients undergoing laparoscopic cautery exclusively.
 Patients with male factor infertility were excluded.
 Estimated cure rates for patients with stage I and II disease were 98.2% and 76.6%, respectively (not significantly different).
 No significant difference was seen when anovulation complicated the endometriosis (68.6%).
 When greater than one infertility factor was present, a significant difference was observed (50.6%).
 Patients with stage I disease had an average fecundity of 10.30% with decreasing values observed in stage II (7.59%), anovulation (6.67%), and more than one infertility factor (3.33%).
 We conclude that laparoscopic cauterization is an effective mode of therapy for the treatment of stage I and II endometriosis associated with infertility.
