Endotoxin in vaginal fluid of women with bacterial vaginosis.
 The concentration of endotoxin in vaginal fluid was measured in 19 women with bacterial vaginosis and in nine controls with normal vaginal flora.
 The vaginal fluid of the women with bacterial vaginosis contained significantly greater amounts of endotoxin: 0.308 +/- 0.396 versus 0.008 +/- 0.002 endotoxin units/mg vaginal fluid.
 Endotoxin in vaginal fluid may contribute to the activation of the prostaglandin system, which could provoke premature labor.
