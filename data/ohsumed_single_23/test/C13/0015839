Intraoperative management of ureteral injury during operative laparoscopy.
 Injury to the ureter from operative laparoscopy is rare.
 The diagnosis is usually made radiologically, in the postoperative period, when the patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of ureteral injury.
 We report herein a case of ureteral injury resulting from operative laparoscopy for endometriosis.
 The injury was diagnosed and treated via laparoscopy during the same procedure.
 The increased utilization of operative laparoscopy to perform more complex procedures increases the potential for operative injury to the ureter.
 Prior visualization or retroperitoneal dissection of the ureter, in appropriate cases, will help reduce this complication and/or permit a prompt diagnosis in the event of such injury.
