Pregnancy-related mortality in New York City, 1980 to 1984: causes of death and associated risk factors.
 To identify causes and risk factors for pregnancy-related mortality in New York City, we analyzed 224 pregnancy-related deaths that occurred from 1980 to 1984.
 The leading causes of death were ectopic pregnancy complications, embolism, intrapartum cardiac arrest, and hypertension.
 Mortality ratios were determined by comparing the characteristics of the women whose death was pregnancy-related with those of women who had survived delivery of a live infant in New York City during the same period.
 Black and Hispanic women had mortality ratios that were respectively 4.2 and 2.0 times higher than those for white, non-Hispanic women.
 In comparison with women aged 20 to 24, those older than 30 were more than twice as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes, and those older than 40 were five times as likely to do so.
 Other factors that were associated with an increased risk of pregnancy-related mortality included 9 to 11 years of education, lack of private medical insurance, more than five previous pregnancies, and fewer than five prenatal visits.
 This study suggests that changes in current maternal-health and family-planning services will be required to achieve further reductions in preventable pregnancy-related mortality.
