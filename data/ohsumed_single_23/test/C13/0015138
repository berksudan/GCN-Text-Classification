Endometrial ablation with the roller ball electrode.
 Endometrial ablation for control of menorrhagia is a safe, effective alternative to hysterectomy in selected patients.
 Endometrial ablation with a resectoscope equipped with a roller ball electrode was used on 12 patients.
 The technique appears to be as effective as Nd:YAG laser endometrial ablation and offers gynecologists the advantages of speed, low cost and safety when compared to the laser approach.
