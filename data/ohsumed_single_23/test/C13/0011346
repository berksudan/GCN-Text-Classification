Almitrine mimics hypoxia in fetal sheep with lateral pontine lesions.
 Almitrine bimesylate is a potent and long-lasting respiratory stimulant in adult species.
 It acts by stimulating the peripheral chemoreceptors, where it has been shown to accumulate specifically, although its exact mechanism of action is uncertain.
 In the fetal lamb, however, it produces a profound inhibition of breathing even after denervation of the peripheral chemoreceptors.
 In this respect its action is similar to hypoxia.
 To investigate whether almitrine is hypoxia mimetic, we examined the effect of almitrine in nine fetal lambs of 120-130 days gestation.
 Five had lesions in the lateral pons that changed the fetal depressive response to hypoxia to one of stimulation.
 In the remaining four fetuses, the lesions did not bilaterally encompass the appropriate area of the pons; thus they still showed the normal fetal depressive response to hypoxia and so acted as controls.
 Almitrine (10 mg iv) caused a pronounced stimulation of breathing that lasted 406 +/- 26 min in all five fetuses with lesions that caused a stimulatory response to hypoxia.
 However, in the remaining four fetuses, in which the response to hypoxia was inhibitory, almitrine caused an inhibition of breathing that lasted 184 +/- 28 min.
 We conclude that the action of almitrine is like that of hypoxia and that, because it acts specifically on the chemoreceptors, it may prove to be a useful tool in the study of possible central chemoreceptor mechanisms.
