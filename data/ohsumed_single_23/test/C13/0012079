The long-term behavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in rats.
 Prenatal exposure to alcohol can cause a variety of behavioral disturbances later in life.
 Many of the reports in animals of the behavioral teratogenic effects of alcohol have focused on assessing younger animals.
 The purpose of this paper is to review some of the longer lasting behavioral consequences of gestational alcohol exposure in animals.
 It is not meant as a comprehensive review, but rather focuses on selected studies.
 It is concluded that prenatal alcohol exposure does have long lasting effects, although some of these might only occur under challenging or stressful circumstances.
 It is hypothesized that as the animal matures compensatory mechanisms or strategies develop to compensate for these dysfunctions.
 Thus, behavioral problems may only be detected when these compensatory systems break down, either as a result of stress, because of complex testing procedures, or old age.
