Clinical and pathologic correlation of endometrial cavity fluid detected by ultrasound in the postmenopausal patient.
 A registry of ultrasound procedures spanning nearly 5 years was searched retrospectively to discover cases of endometrial cavity fluid collections in postmenopausal women.
 Twenty cases were identified; all medical records were available for review.
 One patient was lost to follow-up.
 Seventeen patients had surgical procedures: 11 had only a D&C, and six had a primary evaluation of laparotomy with removal of the uterus and adnexa.
 Five women had cancer (two ovarian, one tubal, one endometrial, and one cervical); eight women had benign gynecologic conditions, including uterine fibroids (five), ovarian serous cystadenoma (two), and cervical dysplasia (one).
 There were two cases of apparent subclinical pyometra.
 Five women had endometrial pathology consistent with prescribed hormone therapy for breast cancer (four) or endometrial hyperplasia (one).
