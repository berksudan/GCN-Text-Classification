Endometrial thickness as measured by endovaginal ultrasonography for identifying endometrial abnormality.
 Diagnostic curettage has for many years been the method of choice to diagnose endometrial cancer in women with postmenopausal bleeding.
 The costs for curettage performed today are huge, and approximately only 10% in this group of women will be diagnosed with endometrial cancer.
 Thus less expansive techniques to obtain endometrial samples have been evaluated, but all of them are invasive.
 The value of endovaginal ultrasonography for identifying endometrial abnormality in this group of women has not been evaluated until now.
 This study used endometrial thickness as measured by endovaginal ultrasonography as an indicator of endometrial abnormality.
 It was demonstrated in 205 women with postmenopausal bleeding that if the endometrium was less than 9 mm thick, no endometrial cancer was found at curettage.
 The mean endometrial thickness in those women with endometrial cancer was 18.2 +/- 6.2 mm as compared with 3.4 +/- 1.2 mm in those women with atrophic endometrium.
 If the cutoff limit for endometrial abnormality was 5 mm, the positive predictive value for identifying endometrial abnormality was 87.3%.
 If this limit had been used in this study, 70% of the curettage procedures could have been avoided.
