Cellular and metabolic requirements for induction of macrophage procoagulant activity by murine hepatitis virus strain 3 in vitro.
 The cellular basis for the variation in induction of monocyte procoagulant activity (PCA) by murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) was examined using a set of recombinant inbred strains of mice derived from the resistant (A/J) and susceptible C57B1/6J (B) progenitors.
 Induction of PCA by MHV-3 required live virus and host protein and RNA synthesis.
 Absolute restriction for induction of PCA was observed at the level of the macrophage.
 Peritoneal macrophages from resistant parental A/J and RI strains (AXB5) could not be induced to express PCA when stimulated by MHV-3 alone or in the presence of lymphocytes from susceptible and H-2 compatible RI mice (AXB3) although they did respond to endotoxin (LPS).
 In contrast, macrophages from both susceptible (AXB3) and semisusceptible (AXB1) RI strains of mice expressed a similar increase in PCA after stimulation with MHV-3 in the absence of lymphocytes.
 The levels of PCA expressed by macrophages in the presence of Thy-1.2+ lymphocytes correlated with susceptibility to disease.
 Thy-1.2+ lymphocytes from susceptible RI AXB3 mice could induce levels of PCA in macrophages from semisusceptible RI AXB1 mice equivalent to that seen in cultures of macrophages and lymphocytes from susceptible mice.
 Further subfractionation of Thy-1.2+ cells demonstrated that L3T4+ cells instructed macrophages to produce PCA.
 Thy-1.2+ cells from MHV-3 immunized resistant AXB5 mice, but not from non-immunized mice, were able to suppress induction of PCA.
 This suppressor cell activity could be detected 4 days after immunization, reaching maximal activity at day 7 with significant suppression even at 28 days.
 The PCA was shown to have direct prothrombin cleaving activity (prothrombinase) by ELISA and immunofluorescence staining using the mAb 3D4.3.
 These results demonstrate that induction of a unique PCA (prothrombinase) is restricted at the level of the macrophage and define a regulatory role for T lymphocytes in its induction.
