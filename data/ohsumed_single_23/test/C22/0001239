An animal model for human masseter muscle: histochemical characterization of mouse, rat, rabbit, cat, dog, pig, and cow masseter muscle.
 The masseter muscle of several animal species was investigated by use of a histochemical method for the demonstration of acid-stable and alkali-stable myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase).
 The following subdivisions of fiber types were used: Type I fibers show weak ATPase activity at pH 9.4, type IM fibers react moderately, and type II fibers react strongly.
 Rat and mouse masseter muscles contained type II fibers only, as did some rabbit masseter muscles, whereas other rabbit masseter muscles possessed equal amounts of type I and II fibers.
 Cat and dog masseter muscles possessed both type II and I fibers, with type II predominating.
 Cow masseter muscle consisted mainly of type I fibers, although some cow masseter muscles contained a very small number of type II fibers.
 Pig masseter muscle had both type I, II, and IM fibers.
 One of the characteristics of human masseter muscle is type IM fibers, which are rarely seen in muscles other than the masticatory muscles.
 Therefore, pig masseter muscle might be a suitable animal model for experimental studies, such as an investigation of the distribution and diameter of fiber types in the masticatory muscles before and after orthognathic surgery.
