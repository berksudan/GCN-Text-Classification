Mucoid vasculopathy of unknown etiology.
 A new vascular disorder with generalized deposition of abnormal amounts of acid mucopolysaccharide (AMPS) material in arteries, veins, and vasanervorum has been observed in a large number of autopsies at the author's institution.
 It is unlike any of the known vascular diseases and has emerged as a distinct disorder of vascular connective tissue.
 This has been named "mucoid vasculopathy of unknown etiology." This hitherto unreported entity is described here.
