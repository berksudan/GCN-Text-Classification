Angiotensin I-forming angiotensinogenases in extrarenal vasculature and in the kidney.
 The intention of this study was to characterize angiotensin I-forming angiotensinogenases (AIFAs) in rat extrarenal arterial walls and to clarify whether these enzymes are also present in the kidney.
 A further aim was to identify AIFAs in human vasculature and to establish whether they are affected in essential hypertension.
 Sprague-Dawley rats and vascular sections of patients undergoing corrective surgery were studied.
 Enzyme kinetic assays were performed using angiotensin I radioimmunoassay and purified natural angiotensinogens.
 Fast protein liquid chromatography was employed for biochemical characterization.
 A series of AIFAs with various isoelectric points, molecular weights and pH optima was detected in rat extrarenal vascular and, with differing distributions of enzyme activities, in renal tissues.
 In extrarenal arteries the main form of renal renin was present with a relatively low activity only.
 AIFAs were also demonstrable in human extrarenal vasculature and behaved like plasma renin in essential hypertension.
 The results indicate the existence of an intrinsic human vascular RAS in extrarenal (and renal) arteries.
 Extrarenal arterial AIFAs are not generally stimulated in essential hypertensives, as previously postulated.
