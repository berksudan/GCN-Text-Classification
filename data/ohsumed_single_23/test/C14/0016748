Giant left atrium--a case report.
 A seventy-seven-year old woman, with mitral stenosis, presented with cardiomegaly evident on her chest roentgenogram.
 The cardiac enlargement was due to a giant left atrium that distorted the cardiac structures.
 An echocardiogram and a first-pass nuclear angiogram were able to delineate the huge left atrium.
