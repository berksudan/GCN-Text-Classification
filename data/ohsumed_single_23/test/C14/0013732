Gynecologic vascular abnormalities: diagnosis with Doppler US.
 The authors describe the use of duplex and/or color Doppler ultrasonography of the pelvis in three women to demonstrate the presence of venous malformations.
 One patient with a pulsatile vaginal mass was shown to have an arteriovenous malformation of the vaginal wall.
 The second patient was shown to have an unsuspected venous angioma in the endometrial cavity.
 The third patient was shown to have adnexal varices that closely mimicked hydrosalpinx.
 In the latter two cases, the duplex and color flow capabilities of an endovaginal probe were especially important.
