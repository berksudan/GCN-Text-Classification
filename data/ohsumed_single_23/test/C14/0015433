Therapy of ischemic cardiomyopathy with pentoxifylline.
 Abnormal blood rheology is a known characteristics of coronary artery disease.
 The authors evaluated the effects of pentoxifylline on the exercise capacity ejection fraction and symptoms of 9 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
 All patients had signs and symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction.
 All had at least two major vessels obstructed as determined by coronary angiography.
 Pentoxifylline 400 mg three times daily was administered for twelve weeks.
 Seven of 9 patients responded with increases in ejection fraction and exercise tolerance.
 Exercise tolerance correlated with improvement or lack of improvement in ejection fraction.
 For all patients at twelve weeks post-therapy mean ejection fraction increased 9.8% over baseline (p = .07), total treadmill time increased 15% (p = .27), and mean double product increased 13% (p = .03).
 Anginal symptoms were significantly improved over baseline at twelve weeks of therapy (p greater than .001), as well as dyspnea on exertion (p = .03).
 Pentoxifylline was well tolerated.
 Pentoxifylline may benefit ischemic cardiomyopathy by improving coronary perfusion owing to favorable alterations in hemorheologic properties.
