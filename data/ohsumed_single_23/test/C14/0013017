Characteristics of black patients admitted to coronary care units in metropolitan Seattle: results from the Myocardial Infarction Triage and Intervention Registry (MITI).
 Since 1988, 641 black and 11,892 white patients with chest pain of presumed cardiac origin have been admitted to coronary care units in 19 hospitals in metropolitan Seattle.
 Black men and women were younger (58 vs 66, p less than 0.0001), more often admitted to central city hospitals (p less than 0.0001), and developed evidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) less often (19 vs 23%, p = 0.01).
 In the subset of 2,870 AMI patients, blacks (n = 121) were younger (59 vs 67, p less than 0.0001) and had less prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (2 vs 10%, p = 0.005) and more prior hypertension (67 vs 46%, p less than 0.0001).
 During hospitalization, whites (n = 2,749) had higher rates of coronary angioplasty (18 vs 10%, p = 0.03) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (10 vs 4%, p = 0.04), although thrombolytic therapy and cardiac catheterization were used equally in the 2 groups.
 Hospital mortality was 7.4% for black and 13.1% for white patients (p = 0.07).
 However, after adjustment for key demographic and clinical variables by logistic regression, this difference was not as apparent (p = 0.38).
 Questions about the premature onset of coronary artery disease, excess systemic hypertension, and the differential use of interventions in black persons have been raised by other investigators.
 Despite differences in age, referral patterns and the use of coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery, black and white patients with AMI in metropolitan Seattle had similar outcomes.
