Dietary calcium, vascular reactivity, and genetic hypertension in the Lyon rat strain.
 In order to examine the relationship existing between dietary calcium and the development of hypertension, we developed a long-term study in the Lyon hypertensive rat strain (LH) and two control strains, the Lyon normotensive (LN) and low blood pressure rats (LL) given enriched (HCa, 2.5%), deprived (LCa, 0.03%) and normal (NCa, 0.6%) calcium diets.
 Evolution of body weight, systolic blood pressure (BP), plasma calcium and magnesium was monitored from 4 to 23 weeks of age.
 Total cardiovascular reactivity and contractile response of isolated aorta to norepinephrine were measured at 23 weeks of age.
 LH rats on HCa diet failed to develop hypertension (BP less than 150 mm Hg) whereas LH rats on LCa diet exhibited higher blood pressure levels than their controls fed the NCa diet.
 Moreover, in LN rats HCa diet slightly decreased BP whereas LCa had no effect.
 In the LL rats, on the contrary, only LCa diet slightly increased BP.
 In vivo responsiveness to NE was significantly higher in LH compared to LL and LN rats fed a NCa diet.
 HCa and LCa diets both induced a significant decrease in this response in LH rats.
 HCa diet increased the response in LN rats but decreased it in LL.
 In contrast, at the same age, the in vitro contractile response of isolated aorta to NE was significantly decreased in LH compared to LN and LL rats receiving NCa diet.
 Moreover in LH and LN rats on HCa diet the contractile response was markedly increased but no significant difference was observed with LCa diet.
