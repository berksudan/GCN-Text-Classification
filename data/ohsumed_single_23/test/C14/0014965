Monitoring the effect of CPAP on left ventricular function using continuous mixed-blood saturation.
 The hypothetic benefit of CPAP on cardiac performance and on a reduction in VO2 was tested in a patient before heart transplantation after acute myocardial infarction using continuous SvO2 monitoring.
 The CPAP added to inotropic support (enoximone plus dobutamine) and intraaortic balloon pumping dramatically increased SvO2 in relation to both an increase in cardiac output and a decrease in VO2 secondary to respiratory work reduction, validating the initial hypotheses.
