Ischemia and reperfusion during intermittent coronary occlusion in man. Studies of electrocardiographic changes and CPK release.
 The course of 357 balloon inflations performed during 38 angioplasties for single-vessel coronary artery disease was prospectively studied using continuous ECG recording.
 Ischemic ECG changes appeared during 91 percent of the inflations at a mean of 20 +/- 8 seconds after inflation and resolved in 97 percent of those at a mean of 11 +/- 5 seconds after deflation.
 Elevation of the plasma CPK level was found in six patients who had ischemic ECG changes for at least 7.8 minutes.
 The duration of ischemia did not exceed 5.4 minutes in any of the patients without CPK elevation.
 Resolution of the ischemic changes was delayed in patients with CPK elevation and in last vs initial inflations.
 We conclude that in patients with noninfarcted myocardium, ECG changes follow coronary occlusion and reflow very rapidly, detecting these coronary events with a high sensitivity.
 Lack of rapid regression predicts lack of reperfusion, and persistence of ischemia for more than 7.8 minutes is sufficient to cause myocardial necrosis.
