Verapamil increases serum alkaline phosphatase in hypertensive patients.
 In rats, verapamil decreases intestinal absorption of calcium, increases serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), and induces osteopenia.
 In this prospective study, verapamil 80-120 mg three times daily was given for 2 months to 20 patients with hypertension, and the effects on calcium homeostasis were recorded.
 This dose of verapamil significantly reduced supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (+/- SD) from 158/100 +/- 9/8 mmHg to 146/89 +/- 14/8 mmHg (P = 0.001).
 Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased significantly from 2.77 +/- 1.06 mu kat l-1 to 3.19 +/- 1.22 mu kat l-1 (P = 0.004), and isoenzymes of ALP of skeletal origin appeared after verapamil treatment.
 The excretion of sodium in the urine increased (Na/creatinine ratio 8.95 +/- 6.01 before and 13.16 +/- 8.26 after verapamil; P = 0.04), while the excretion of calcium, phosphate and potassium was not changed.
 PTH was slightly increased at the end of verapamil treatment (1.09 +/- 0.54 vs.
 0.98 +/- 0.74 microgram l-1; P = 0.07), and s-1,25(OH)2D3 was also somewhat increased (22.3 +/- 14.4 vs.
 17.6 +/- 4.9 ng l-1; P = 0.26).
 Serum Ca was not affected by verapamil (before verapamil 2.43 +/- 0.11 mmol l-1, after verapamil 2.40 +/- 0.12 mmol l-1; P = 0.28).
 The increase in serum ALP demonstrates that verapamil affects bone cell metabolism in man.
 This effect could be secondary to the enhancement of PTH secretion.
