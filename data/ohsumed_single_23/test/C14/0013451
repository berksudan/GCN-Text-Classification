In-hospital mortality after balloon aortic valvuloplasty: frequency and associated factors.
 Percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty has been accompanied by significant early periprocedural morbidity and mortality.
 Identification of factors associated with increased mortality might allow for improved selection of patients.
 The Mansfield Scientific Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry was analyzed to identify the frequency of in-hospital death and the factors associated with it.
 Of 492 patients undergoing the procedure, 37 (7.5%) died during the hospital stay in which valvuloplasty was performed.
 Twenty-four of these patients died within the first 24 h and the remainder died within 7 days after the procedure.
 There were significant differences in baseline clinical and hemodynamic characteristics as well as procedural and postprocedural variables between patients dying and those surviving the in-hospital period.
 Multivariate analysis identified four factors associated with increased mortality: 1) the occurrence of a procedure-related complication, 2) a lower initial left ventricular systolic pressure, 3) a smaller final aortic valve area, and 4) a lower baseline cardiac output.
 Thus, baseline hemodynamic, procedural and postprocedural variables and complications can be identified that are associated with increased mortality.
