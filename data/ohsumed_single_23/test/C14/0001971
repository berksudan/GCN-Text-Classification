Clinical diagnosis of tamponade in Malawi.
 A consecutive series of 25 Malawian patients with tamponade secondary to tuberculosis were compared to 25 patients with congestive cardiac failure, without pericardial effusion in a retrospective study.
 More patients with tamponade had an impalpable apex beat (21/1), pulsus paradoxus (13/0), soft heart sounds (13/2), paradoxical rise in jugular venous pressure (6/0), and fewer had a murmur (1/14).
 All these results are significant (p less than 0.05) by the chi 2 test with Yates' correction.
 The presence of two or more of these discriminating physical signs has a positive predictive value of 75 per cent, and a negative predictive value of 99.5 per cent for the diagnosis of tamponade.
 Clinical diagnosis of tamponade by primary health care personnel in Malawi should be possible, and lead to earlier treatment.
