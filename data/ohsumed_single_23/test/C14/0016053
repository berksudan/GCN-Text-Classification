Immunosuppressive therapy in the management of acute myocarditis in children: a clinical trial.
 To assess whether steroid therapy influenced the clinical course of myocarditis in a pediatric population, findings in 13 consecutive infants and children (8 female, 5 male) with biopsy-proved myocarditis were reviewed.
 The mean age was 5.7 +/- 4.8 years (range 1.1 to 14.8).
 Congestive heart failure was present in all as were ST-T wave changes, cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema on chest roentgenogram.
 Echocardiography demonstrated pericardial effusion in five patients and mitral regurgitation in eight.
 Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 34 +/- 12%.
 Prednisone was administered to all patients; one patient also received azathioprine.
 There was one death.
 All survivors showed clinical improvement with normalization of ECG changes, heart size and systolic function.
 No significant side effects occurred.
 Repeat myocardial biopsy in eight patients demonstrated improvement in all eight and elimination of the inflammatory infiltrate in six.
 Immunosuppressive therapy in this pediatric population appeared useful in improving the clinical course and cardiac function in acute myocarditis with no adverse side effects.
