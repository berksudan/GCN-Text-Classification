Deterioration following delay in performing femoral angioplasty.
 It is not uncommon for a delay to occur between assessment arteriography and angioplasty attempt.
 We reviewed retrospectively the arteriograms of 61 patients where such a delay occurred to assess progression of superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease in this interval.
 A mean delay of 14.6 days (range 2-60 days) occurred between arteriogram and angioplasty attempt.
 Arteriographic deterioration was found in six of 61 patients (9.8%) and in three this precluded angioplasty.
 Of the six patients four had initial arteriography via the same side as the SFA disease whilst two had arteriography via the contralateral femoral approach.
 We discuss the aetiology of this phenomenon and suggestions are made to reduce its incidence.
