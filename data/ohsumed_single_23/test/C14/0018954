Repair of posterior left ventricular aneurysm in a six-year-old boy.
 Left ventricular aneurysms and diverticula are rarely encountered in the pediatric age group.
 This paper reports a case of congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation in a 6-year-old boy with a large posterolateral left ventricular aneurysm.
 Complete repair was successfully performed by excision of the aneurysm and Dacron patch reconstruction of the left ventricular free wall.
 The patch extended onto the posterior annulus of the mitral valve, thus restoring the mitral valve to normal geometry and correcting the mitral insufficiency.
 The surgical literature on congenital cardiac diverticula and acquired aneurysms in children is reviewed and summarized.
