Comparison of pre- and postoperative conduction patterns in patients surgically cured of atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia.
 Patients with atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia characteristically have short and constant retrograde His-atrium conduction times (H2A2 intervals) during the introduction of ventricular extrastimuli.
 It has therefore been suggested that the tachycardia circuit involves retrograde conduction up an accessory pathway located in perinodal tissue.
 If the mechanism of surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is interruption of this accessory pathway, postoperative changes in retrograde conduction would be expected.
 Thirteen patients with drug-refractory AV node reentrant tachycardia underwent surgery.
 Preoperatively, H2A2 intervals were short and constant.
 During AV node reentrant tachycardia, earliest atrial activation was seen near the His bundle and was 0 to 25 ms before ventricular activation in all patients except one.
 Surgery consisted of dissection of right atrial septal and anterior inputs to the AV node and central fibrous body.
 Postoperatively, the H2A2 interval remained short and constant compared with preoperative values although it was slightly prolonged (74 +/- 18 versus 61 +/- 21 ms, p less than 0.005).
 Twelve of the 13 patients are free of tachycardia after 28 +/- 13 months and no patient has had evidence of AV node block.
 Thus, surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is highly successful; however, there is no reason to postulate an accessory pathway or use of perinodal tissue as part of the tachycardia circuit and the mechanism of surgical success remains obscure.
