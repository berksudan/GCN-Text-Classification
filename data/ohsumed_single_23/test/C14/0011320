Congestive heart failure: a current overview.
 Congestive heart failure (CHF), a disease seen primarily in the older patient, can be due to either systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
 Management is quite different if the heart failure is due to a filling abnormality as compared to poor ventricular systole.
 The disorder also poses many diagnostic pitfalls in the elderly.
 Current understanding of CHF and its influence on diagnosis and management is the focus of this review.
