Coronary trapping of a complement activation product (C3a des-Arg) during myocardial reperfusion in open-heart surgery.
 Accumulation of complement factors has been found to occur in the myocardium after infarction.
 We studied the possibility that the complement activation product C3a des-Arg is trapped within the coronary circulation during reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium.
 In 11 patients undergoing routine coronary artery bypass grafting, arterial blood was sampled before, during and after cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Blood was drawn from the coronary sinus concomitantly with arterial blood sampling 5 and 30 min after release of the aortic cross-clamp (n = 10).
 From a preoperative value of 92 +/- 13 ng/ml, C3a des-Arg rose during CPB to a maximum of 1816 +/- 393 at the end of CPB.
 Following reperfusion for 5 min, C3a des-Arg was 1284 +/- 232 ng/ml in arterial and 1106 +/- 100 in coronary sinus blood, a significant difference (p less than 0.05).
 The amount of C3a des-Arg trapped in the heart at 5-min reperfusion showed positive correlation with its arterial concentration (p less than 0.05).
 No significant difference was found after 30 min of reperfusion.
 Complement activation products trapped in the heart in the early reperfusion period may play a pathogenetic role in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.
