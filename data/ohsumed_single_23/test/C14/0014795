Dopamine and high-dose insulin infusion (glucose-insulin-potassium) after a cardiac operation: effects on myocardial metabolism.
 Myocardial insulin resistance, in association with surgical stress, restricts the availability of carbohydrates and increases the load of free fatty acids (FFAs) on the heart.
 On theoretical grounds adrenergic drugs may be expected to aggravate this situation, whereas the opposite is expected from insulin.
 The influence of dopamine and a combination of dopamine (7 micrograms/kg body weight/min) and high-dose insulin (7 IU/kg) on myocardial energy metabolism was studied in 19 patients 4 to 6 hours after a coronary operation.
 Infusion of dopamine (7 micrograms/kg body weight/min) induced metabolic changes that may be unfavorable to the strained myocardium.
 There was an increase of the myocardial FFA load and a rise in myocardial oxygen expenditure by 60% to 70%.
 There changes were, however, not matched by an increase in myocardial substrate uptake.
 "Oxygen wastage" of FFA metabolism at high circulating catecholamine levels is suggested.
 There were also signs suggesting an amplified systemic trauma response: systemic oxygen consumption increased by 15%, and an increase in the arterial levels of FFAs, glucose, and ketones was observed.
 Divergent metabolic effects of dopamine and insulin were demonstrated.
 The most prominent metabolic effects of adding high-dose insulin to dopamine were a marked reduction of arterial FFA levels and a shift toward myocardial carbohydrate utilization at the expense of FFAs.
 Myocardial uptake of FFAs ceased.
 Myocardial insulin resistance may thus to a significant extent be overcome by supraphysiological doses of insulin, even during infusion of adrenergic drugs.
