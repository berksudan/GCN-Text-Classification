Cardiac rehabilitation after coronary artery bypass grafting: effects on exercise performance and risk factors.
 After coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 49 nonselected patients followed a cardiac rehabilitation program that included medical follow-up and physical training, both in outpatient groups and on an individual basis at home.
 The effect of the program on exercise test variables, coronary risk factors, and medication one year after surgery was compared to a nonexercised control group (n = 98).
 The study group showed less increase in the rate-pressure product, indicating a favorable effect on myocardial oxygen consumption (0.7 +/- 5.4 vs 2.8 +/- 5.6, p less than .05); a lower frequency of angina at exercise testing (6% vs 18%, p less than .01); a reduction in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (9/4mmHg, p less than .01); fewer smokers (6% vs 17%, p less than .05); and fewer patients taking long-acting nitrates (0% vs 10.2%, p less than .05).
 It is suggested, therefore, that an organized cardiac rehabilitation program may be advantageous after CABG.
