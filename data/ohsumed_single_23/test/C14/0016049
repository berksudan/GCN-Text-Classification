Echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac structure and function in elderly subjects with isolated systolic hypertension 
 One hundred four participants in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial (mean age 71 +/- 6 years) were examined by Doppler echocardiography to gain information on the cardiac structural and functional alterations in isolated systolic hypertension.
 Participants had a systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg and were compared with 55 age-matched normotensive control subjects.
 Left ventricular mass index was significantly higher in the participants than in the normotensive subjects (103 +/- 28 versus 87 +/- 23 g/m2, p = 0.0014) and 26% of the participants met echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy compared with 10% of normotensive subjects.
 Left atrial index was also greater in participants than in normotensive subjects (2.26 +/- 0.32 versus 2.11 +/- 0.24 cm/m2, p = 0.005) and 51% of participants had left atrial enlargement.
 Doppler measures of diastolic filling were significantly different between the two groups, with peak atrial velocity higher (76 +/- 17 versus 69 +/- 17 cm/s, p = 0.02) and ratio of peak early to atrial velocity lower (0.76 +/- 0.23 versus 0.86 +/- 0.22, p = 0.0124) in participants.
 There was no correlation between left ventricular mass index and Doppler measures of diastolic function, but relative wall thickness correlated significantly with peak atrial velocity (r = 0.22, p = 0.016) and peak early to peak atrial velocity ratio (r = 0.24, p = 0.007).
 There was no difference in M-mode ejection phase indexes of systolic performance (shortening fraction and peak velocity of circumferential fiber shortening) between the two groups.
