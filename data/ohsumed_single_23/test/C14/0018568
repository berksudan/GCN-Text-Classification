Prostacyclin production in myocardial infarction in the acute phase and during follow-up.
 Twenty-five patients with myocardial infarction were monitored in the acute phase and during follow-up with regard to the in vivo production of prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TxA2), by measurement of their major urinary metabolites, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-TxB2, respectively.
 In 22 of these patients PGI2 and TxA2 production were also assessed before, during and after an exercise test performed 6 weeks after discharge.
 In approximately 24% of patients the in vivo production of prostacyclin did not increase during the acute phase of the infarction process.
 This inability was usually associated with a decrease in the release of heart muscle enzymes, and was mostly frequently observed in women.
 During the exercise tolerance test, none of the patients showed any increase in prostacyclin production, in contrast to healthy volunteers, in whom a significant increase was seen.
 There were no differences between patients with and without an increase in prostacyclin production during the acute phase.
 At the follow-up 2 years after the myocardial infarction, eight cardiac events had occurred, all of which were noted among patients who exhibited an expected increase in prostacyclin production in association with the infarction.
 This would seem reasonable, since most of the patients in this group had larger primary infarctions.
