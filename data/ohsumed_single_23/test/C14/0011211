Renal vein thrombosis. Initial manifestation of Goodpasture's syndrome.
 We report a patient who presented with renal vein thrombosis and nephrosis that progressed to alveolar hemorrhage and renal failure.
 Renal biopsy immunofluorescence and serum antiglomerular basement membrane antibody titer studies confirmed the diagnosis of Goodpasture's syndrome.
 To our knowledge, this is the first report of renal vein thrombosis as the initial presentation of Goodpasture's syndrome.
