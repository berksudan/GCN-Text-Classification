Popliteal aneurysms identified by intra-arterial streptokinase: a changing pattern of presentation.
 Five patients presenting with chronic or subacute leg ischaemia due to thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm are described.
 Only one of these aneurysms was diagnosed before intra-arterial streptokinase infusion, which successfully lysed the thrombus in all cases.
 One aneurysm had been symptomatic for 5 years and another for 2 years.
 Popliteal aneurysm may well be underdiagnosed as a cause of chronic leg ischaemia.
