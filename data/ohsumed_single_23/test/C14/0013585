The role of duplex scanning in the selection of patients for transluminal angioplasty.
 As part of our initial evaluation to determine whether patients with lower extremity ischemia are candidates for intervention, arterial duplex examinations are performed in the noninvasive vascular laboratory.
 Patients with isolated short stenoses on the duplex examination are referred for transluminal angioplasty.
 One hundred thirty-four arteriograms were performed for ischemic peripheral vascular disease in 122 patients between July 1987 and March 1990.
 One hundred ten (82%) of the arteriograms were preceded by a lower extremity arterial duplex evaluation.
 Fifty cases (45%) were scheduled for transluminal angioplasty based on the findings of the duplex examination.
 Transluminal angioplasty was performed in 47 of 50 cases (94%).
 No significant differences in age, sex, or diabetes were found between the patients who were referred for transluminal angioplasty and those who were not.
 These data demonstrate that duplex scanning of the lower extremities allows the detection of lesions that will be amenable to transluminal angioplasty.
 We think that duplex scanning should become the standard screening tool for detection of treatable lower extremity lesions.
