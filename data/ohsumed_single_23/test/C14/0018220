Angina, ischemia, and effort tolerance with vasodilating beta-blockers.
 beta-Blockers are known to suppress exercise-induced ischemia but give rise to such problems as fatigue or dyspnea on effort and also bradycardia.
 In a series of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of celiprolol (a cardioselective beta 1-blocker with beta 2-agonist and vasodilatory properties) in patients with hypertension and angina and in normal volunteers, it was found that celiprolol did not produce bradycardia when given in combination with verapamil.
 Celiprolol did reduce exercise-induced ischemia, but there was no reduction in cardiac output at rest or on exercise compared with placebo.
 Compared with atenolol, celiprolol produced less dyspnea and fatigue at submaximal levels of exercise.
 It is concluded that celiprolol possesses certain differences, compared with conventional beta-blockers, that may be of direct clinical benefit.
