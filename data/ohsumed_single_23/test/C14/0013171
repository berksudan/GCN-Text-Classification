Estimating left ventricular filling pressure during positive end-expiratory pressure in humans.
 In the critically ill, accurate measurements of left ventricular (LV) filling pressure using pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (Ppao) are important for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
 In patients receiving positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), Ppao may not reflect LV filling pressure because of elevated pericardial pressure (Ppc).
 It has been proposed that in humans, Ppc and right atrial pressure (PRA) are equal, so that referencing Ppao to PRA may improve the assessment of LV filling pressure when Ppc is elevated.
 Similarly, it has also been shown in the dog that nadir Ppao immediately after airway disconnection from PEEP (nadir Ppao), accurately reflects LV filling pressure when LV filling pressure is greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg.
 We examined methods of estimating LV filling pressure using Ppao measurements under conditions in which increases in Ppc were the primary determinants of differences in the two measurements.
 Using left atrial pressure (PLA) relative to Ppc, called transmural PLA (PLAtm), as LV filling pressure, we compared the accuracy of Ppao, nadir Ppao, and Ppao relative to PRA to reflect PLAtm in 15 postoperative cardiac surgery patients in whom an air-filled pericardial balloon catheter and a left atrial catheter were inserted during surgery.
 PEEP was sequentially increased from zero to 15 cm H2O.
 We found that PRA always exceeded Ppc (p less than 0.01) and increased less with PEEP than did Ppc (p less than 0.05).
 At less than or equal to 5 cm H2O PEEP, both Ppao and nadir Ppao were similar to each other and to PLAtm.
