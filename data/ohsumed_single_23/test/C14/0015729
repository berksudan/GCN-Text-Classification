Secular trends in Q wave and non-Q wave acute myocardial infarction. The Minnesota Heart Survey.
 The Minnesota Heart Survey examined trends of Q wave and non-Q wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using a 50% random sample of all hospital discharges of patients with AMI or another acute coronary disease from 35 of 36 hospitals in 1970 and 30 of 31 hospitals in 1980 in the Minneapolis-St.
 Paul metropolitan area.
 A total of 1,901 and 1,864 potential AMI cases were abstracted in 1970 and 1980, respectively.
 Electrocardiograms were coded according to the Minnesota code.
 AMIs were validated by computerized algorithm based on chest pain, enzymes, electrocardiograms, and autopsy.
 This study shows that with the use of a consistent, standard diagnostic algorithm, attack rates for Q wave AMI did not change significantly between 1970 and 1980 and that attack rates for non-Q wave AMI decreased significantly during the same decade.
 However, when the more sensitive cardiac enzymes creatine phosphokinase and creatine phosphokinase-MB were considered, attack rates of both Q wave and non-Q wave AMIs increased.
 This research documents four important trends for community AMI rates that are at variance with those reported by others.
 There was a decline in non-Q wave AMI attack rates from 1970 to 1980; women had outcomes equal to or worse than those for men for both case-fatality and 7-year survival rates; patients with non-Q wave AMIs had worse in-hospital prognoses than those with Q wave AMIs; and 7-year survival rates were worse for Q wave AMI in 1980.
 These findings demonstrate the need for standard diagnostic criteria for Q wave and non-Q wave AMI if trends are to be monitored.
 In the future, as new trials of operative and nonoperative therapies of AMI are undertaken, these considerations will increase in importance.
