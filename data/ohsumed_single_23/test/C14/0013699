Cineangiography of the heart in a single breath hold with a segmented turboFLASH sequence.
 Six healthy volunteers and three patients with cardiac anomalies were studied in a comparison of segmented turboFLASH (fast low-angle shot) cine, a method of magnetic resonance imaging that permits an entire series of high-resolution cine images to be obtained in one breath hold, with standard cine.
 Segmented turboFLASH uses a gradient-echo sequence designed for short imaging times in combination with a segmented data acquisition method.
 Presaturation pulses were applied to eliminate the blood pool signal; the signal-to-noise ratio was assessed with a phantom.
 Standard hardware and image reconstruction methods were used.
 The breath-hold images consistently showed reduced ghosting and blurring from respiration.
 Because a very short echo time was used, segmented turboFLASH was relatively insensitive to dephasing caused by local field disturbances or flow.
 The authors conclude that, by reducing imaging times and eliminating respiratory artifact, segmented turboFLASH can be useful for performing cine studies of the heart and great vessels.
