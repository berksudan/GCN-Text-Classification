Preoperative evaluation and surgical treatment for tricuspid regurgitation associated with acquired valvular heart disease. The Kay-Boyd method vs the Carpentier-Edwards ring method.
 This study compared the results of annuloplastic repair of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) using Doppler echocardiography.
 Sixty-three patients who underwent tricuspid annuloplasty were studied.
 Thirty-four patients received Kay-Boyd annuloplasty and 29 Carpentier-Edwards ring annuloplasty.
 A new classification of TR based on the direction and area of regurgitation flow on Doppler echocardiogram was applied preoperatively.
 In the Kay-Boyd group, 10 cases showed massive TR and 24 cases showed localized TR preoperatively.
 Localized TR was well controlled in all cases, but 8 of 9 cases of massive TR showed grade III residual TR.
 In the C-E group, 21 cases showed massive TR and 8 cases showed localized TR.
 All cases were well controlled postoperatively.
 We conclude that (1) although the Kay-Boyd method is acceptable for localized TR, the C-E method should be employed for massive TR; (2) analyzing the regurgitant pattern of TR by Doppler echocardiogram is useful in selecting an appropriate surgical technique.
