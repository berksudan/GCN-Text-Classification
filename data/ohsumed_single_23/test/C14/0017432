Depression after acute myocardial infarction. The role of primary care physicians in rehabilitation.
 Depression is a common problem after myocardial infarction.
 Diagnosis is facilitated by use of the criteria for depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and self-rating questionnaires.
 Treatment may involve both psychological and pharmacologic interventions.
 The patient's medical status must be carefully assessed before administration of antidepressant medication.
 All antidepressants are contraindicated immediately after myocardial infarction.
 When signs and symptoms of depression are exhibited early in the recovery phase, alprazolam (Xanax) may offer advantages over more traditional antidepressants.
 Further research is necessary to determine the safety of newer antidepressants.
