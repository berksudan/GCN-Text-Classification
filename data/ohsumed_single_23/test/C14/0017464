Renal vein renins: inability to predict response to revascularization in patients with hypertension.
 To determine whether the captopril-stimulated renal vein renin ratio (CSRVRR) could enable identification of patients with hemodynamically significant renovascular lesions who would respond to revascularization, the authors measured CSRVRRs in 143 consecutive patients with hypertension who had been selected because of clinical features suggestive of renovascular hypertension.
 All patients underwent conventional renal arteriography.
 Renovascular hypertension was the final diagnosis if revascularization resulted in cure or improvement in blood pressure.
 Complete data were available for 133 patients.
 Twenty patients had renovascular hypertension; CSRVRR was greater than 1.5 in 13 of these 20 patients (sensitivity, 65%).
 However, it was also greater than 1.5 in 54 of the 113 patients without renovascular hypertension (false-positive rate, 47.8%).
 The positive predictive value of CSRVRR was 18.6%; the negative predictive value, 89.3%.
 It is concluded that CSRVRR is not sufficiently sensitive to enable prediction of which patients will respond to revascularization and is not specific enough to exclude patients who do not have renovascular hypertension.
