Calcium channel blockers in geriatric hypertension.
 Though the calcium channel blockers have been used to treat angina pectoris for almost a decade, the long-acting forms of these agents that have become available in the last few years have made them practical for use as antihypertensive agents as well.
 They are becoming increasingly popular in this role, especially to treat elderly hypertensive patients.
 Because they are vasodilators with a mild diuretic action, they are logical treatment choices for the majority of hypertensive patients who have increased peripheral vascular resistance.
 They offer the advantage of a dual benefit for hypertensive patients with angina, and they have no effect on carbohydrate or lipid metabolism.
 Disadvantages include cost and a side effect profile that includes headaches, palpitations, ankle edema, and constipation.
