Usefulness of blood lactate as a predictor of shock development in acute myocardial infarction [published erratum appears in Am J Cardiol 1991 Apr 15;67(9):912]
 Data were obtained and analyzed in 229 patients admitted to the coronary care unit from November 1988 through July 1989.
 The patients were classified into 2 groups: patients without or with only mild left ventricular failure (Killip class I or II) during their hospital stay (group I), and patients who were in Killip class I or II on admission but developed cardiogenic shock during hospitalization (group II).
 Discriminant function analysis was performed using the following variables: patients' age, history of previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, blood lactate, urea, creatinine, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase concentrations, and chest x-ray cardiothoracic ratio.
 Variables that were found to significantly discriminate the 2 groups of patients were age, previous infarction, x-ray cardiothoracic ratio, blood urea and lactate concentrations.
 The risk index was computed, and blood lactate was the variable with the greatest predictive power for shock development.
 The sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the risk index, taking various cutoff points, were calculated.
 With a cutoff value of 1, sensitivity was 65%, specificity 91%, positive predictive value 36% and negative predictive value 97%.
 With a cutoff value of 2, sensitivity was 53%, specificity 99%, positive predictive value 82% and negative predictive value 96%.
