Cerebral air embolism treated by pressure and hyperbaric oxygen.
 We used pressure and hyperbaric oxygen to treat 2 patients with cerebral air embolism, occurring as the result of invasive medical procedures, and neither suffered any permanent damage detectable by clinical examination and MRI.
 This outcome contrasts with reports of infarct and disability among untreated victims of air embolism.
