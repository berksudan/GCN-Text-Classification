Surgical repair of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome complicated with myocardial bridging.
 Myocardial bridging causes myocardial ischemia during supraventricular tachycardia.
 We present a case of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome combined with myocardial bridging.
 The patient complained of angina pectoris during paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia because of severe constriction of the left anterior descending coronary artery during systole.
 A myocardial scintigram revealed myocardial ischemia in the anteroseptal wall during paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
 Myotomy to prevent myocardial bridging and interruption of the accessory conduction pathway was successfully accomplished in a one-stage operation.
