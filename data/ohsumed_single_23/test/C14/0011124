[Ca2+]i transients in the cardiomyopathic hamster heart.
 Intracellular [Ca2+] transients were studied in isolated hearts of healthy and cardiomyopathic hamsters in late failure perfused with glucose or pyruvate.
 Hearts of healthy hamsters developed similar pressures when perfused with either glucose or pyruvate, and [Ca2+]i transients were comparable in amplitude when perfused with either substrate.
 On the other hand, hearts of cardiomyopathic hamsters in late failure developed normal pressure when perfused with pyruvate but developed depressed pressure (50%) when perfused with glucose.
 The amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients fell severely and was associated with a high diastolic [Ca2+]i in cardiomyopathic hamster hearts when the perfusate was switched from pyruvate to glucose.
 The high phosphomonoester sugars as evidenced by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance studies and the depressed oxygen consumption in the cardiomyopathic hamster hearts perfused with glucose reflect an inhibition in glycolysis and a subsequent decrease in mitochondrial activity.
 Without an adequate delivery of substrate to the mitochondria in the cardiomyopathic hamster, the myocardium is no longer capable of maintaining its [Ca2+]i homeostasis.
