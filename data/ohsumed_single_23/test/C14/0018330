Torsades de pointes therapy with phenytoin.
 We present the case of a woman with myocardial infarction complicated by malignant ventricular arrhythmia and torsades de pointes.
 The torsades de pointes was refractory to conventional therapy but responsive to phenytoin.
 This case suggests the clinical usefulness of phenytoin for adjunct therapy of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when standard treatment modalities fail.
