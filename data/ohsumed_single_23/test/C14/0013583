Arterial aneurysms in children: clinicopathologic classification.
 Thirty-one arterial macroaneurysms in 23 pediatric-aged patients (16 boys and 7 girls) were treated at the University of Michigan.
 The average age at time of diagnosis was 10.2 years (range 6 months to 18 years).
 Vessels involved the aorta (4), as well as hepatic (1), splenic (2), gastroepiploic (1), renal (12), iliac (1), superficial femoral (4), popliteal (1), brachial (1), radial (2), and ulnar (2) arteries.
 Twelve children exhibited overt clinical manifestations including presence of a mass (7), local pain (3), hematemesis (1), and painless obstructive jaundice (1).
 Eleven children had asymptomatic lesions.
 Aneurysm existence was confirmed by arteriography or operation.
 All but one child underwent surgical therapy, with 20 long-term survivors (mean follow-up 3.5 years).
 One operative death occurred and one death occurred 6 years after surgery.
 This experience and a review of previously reported cases served as a basis for categorization of childhood aneurysmal disease as true aneurysms associated with (I) arterial infection, (II) giant-cell aortoarteritis, (III) autoimmune connective tissue disease, (IV) Kawasaki's disease, (V) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or Marfan's syndrome, (VI) other forms of noninflammatory medial degeneration, (VII) arterial dysplasias, (VIII) congenital-idiopathic factors, as well as (IX) false aneurysms associated with extravascular events causing vessel wall injury or disruption.
 Knowledge of the varied clinicopathologic characteristics of arterial aneurysms in children is important in treating these patients.
