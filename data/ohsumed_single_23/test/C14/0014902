Transoesophageal echocardiogram may fail to diagnose perioperative myocardial infarction.
 We report a case in which a 55-yr-old man undergoing aortocoronary bypass was monitored with electrocardiogram and transoesophageal echocardiogram.
 Intraoperative electrocardiogram and simultaneous ECG recordings using the Holter monitor showed an ST elevation of greater than 2 mm and new Q wave formation in leads AVF and V5 during skin closure.
 However, the transoesophageal echocardiogram showed no wall motion abnormalities.
 No significant haemodynamic abnormalities were observed during the period of intraoperative ECG changes.
 He was treated with nitroglycerin infusion.
 Confirmation of a perioperative myocardial infarct was documented by postoperative 12-lead ECG and CPK-MB.
 A post-operative transthoracic echocardiogram showed a hypokinetic left ventricle with an anteroapical infarct.
 Thus transoesophageal echocardiography failed to detect an apical wall motion abnormality when the probe was placed at the midpapillary level.
 This limitation can be overcome by periodically obtaining apical views or by using probes with more than one imaging plane.
