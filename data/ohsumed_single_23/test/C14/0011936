Effects of doxazosin on serum lipids: a review of the clinical data and molecular basis for altered lipid metabolism.
 The goal of antihypertensive treatment must be not only the reduction of high blood pressure, but also the effective management of elevated cholesterol levels and other risk factors of coronary heart disease (CHD).
 In controlled clinical trials, doxazosin has been shown to have antihypertensive efficacy comparable with other classes of antihypertensive agents and to lower the levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides while increasing the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
 Doxazosin appears to inhibit the development of CHD on two fronts.
 First, doxazosin binds to the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor and inhibits the receptor-mediated responses to epinephrine and norepinephrine.
 Second, doxazosin has direct and indirect effects on lipid metabolism by increasing LDL receptor activity, decreasing intracellular LDL synthesis, reducing the synthesis and secretion of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and stimulating lipoprotein lipase activity.
 Doxazosin may also inhibit platelet aggregation.
 Long-term studies will determine how these actions translate into reductions in the morbidity and mortality rates of CHD.
 First-year results from the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) have demonstrated expected reductions in blood pressure for all antihypertensive agents studied.
 The lipid changes have varied with the type of antihypertensive treatment and have been favorable for doxazosin.
