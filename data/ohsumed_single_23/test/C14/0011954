Efficacy and safety of doxazosin in the treatment of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension and elevated levels of cholesterol.
 In hypertensive patients, elevated serum cholesterol is a frequent and sinister additional coronary risk factor.
 Selective alpha 1-adrenoreceptor inhibitors appear to have the unique ability to control both risk factors.
 Forty-two patients, ages 42 to 65 years, including 21 men with sustained hypertension and elevated serum cholesterol levels, were included in a trial of monotherapy with doxazosin administered once daily (range, 1 to 16 mg).
 The influence of the drug on high blood pressure and elevated serum cholesterol was evaluated over a 28-week period, which consisted of a 4-week, single-blind placebo lead-in period, an open 10-week dose-adjustment period, and finally a 14-week maintenance period.
 Of the 39 efficacy-evaluable patients, 25 (64%) achieved adequate blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure greater than 10 mm Hg) at a mean daily dose of 2 mg of doxazosin.
 No persistent changes occurred in heart rate.
 In the 32 patients with evaluable lipid data, there were nonsignificant trends to an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a reduction in total cholesterol, together with a significant reduction in serum triglyceride concentration.
 The combined changes in blood pressure and blood lipid levels resulted in a reduction of 36% in the calculated risk of coronary heart disease.
 Eleven patients reported side effects and four were withdrawn from therapy.
 These results confirm the antihypertensive and anticholesterolemic efficacy of once-daily treatment with doxazosin.
