Skewflap versus long posterior flap in below-knee amputations: multicenter trial.
 A multicenter trial of alternative techniques for below-knee amputation is described in which surgeons in 11 centers randomized 191 patients with end-stage occlusive vascular disease to two different methods of stump construction.
 The skewflap technique was performed in 98 and the long posterior flap was performed in 93.
 The two groups were well matched in respect to age, sex, smoking, diabetes, and indications for amputation.
 Early outcome was compared in terms of 30-day mortality rate: skew 11 (11%) deaths versus long posterior flap 16 (17%); the state of the wound at 1 week (primary healing 60% in both groups); the need for surgical revision at the same level 7 (7%) versus 7 (8%), and revision to a higher level 10 (10%) versus 7 (8%).
 Follow-up information at 6 months was available from records or by mailed questionnaire in 188 (98%) at 6 months, 20 died during that interval.
 It showed that a prosthetic limb was fitted to 64 (84%) of skew flaps and 50 (77%) of long posterior flaps.
 Walking, alone or with support, was achieved in 59 (78%) and 46 (71%), respectively.
 None of these differences reached statistical significance.
 It is concluded that the skew flap is just as effective as the long posterior flap and is an excellent option for below-knee amputation.
