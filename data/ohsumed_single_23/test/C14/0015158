The accuracy of CT scanning in the diagnosis of abdominal and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.
 As CT scanning has evolved as a reliable clinical tool, the use of angiography in the diagnosis of aortic aneurysmal disease has diminished.
 Fewer than 25% of patients with aortic aneurysmal disease undergo aortic angiographic evaluation at our institution.
 A prospective clinical study was undertaken to assess the validity of this policy.
 One hundred patients with clinical or ultrasonographic evidence of aortic aneurysms were evaluated prospectively during the period July 1987 to December 1989.
 All patients underwent CT scanning as an initial evaluation.
 Patients were selected for angiography if they fulfilled any of the following criteria: radiographic evidence of thoracoabdominal or juxtarenal aneurysms, or horseshoe kidney; or clinical suggestion of renal artery stenosis, mesenteric arterial insufficiency, aortoiliac occlusive disease, or lower extremity aneurysmal disease.
 During this period 19 patients (19%) underwent both CT scanning and angiography.
 The indications for angiography were thoracoabdominal aneurysms (7), juxtarenal aneurysms (2), clinical evidence of mesenteric insufficiency (1) or renal insufficiency (2), evidence of lower extremity aneurysmal disease (3), or severe aortoiliac occlusive disease (4).
 Eighty-one patients (81%) underwent CT scanning as the only radiographic evaluation.
 No patient was adversely affected by elimination of angiographic evaluation.
 CT scanning revealed inflammatory aneurysms (4), retroaortic renal veins (2), and horseshoe kidney (1).
 This study suggests that most (81%) patients with aortic aneurysmal disease can be adequately evaluated by CT scanning, and that a very selective policy of angiographic evaluation is indicated.
