Critical ischemia times and survival patterns of experimental pig flaps.
 Previous work on critical ischemia time suggested (1) a greater susceptibility of myocutaneous flaps over skin flaps to the ischemia reperfusion injury and (2) that duration of ischemia may affect the survival area of a flap.
 Using a pig model, 55 animals were operated on and the critical ischemia times and survival patterns of the buttock skin (n = 85) and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous (n = 88) island flaps were determined after being submitted to 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 hours of normothermic ischemia.
 The average critical ischemia times (CIT50) were determined to be 9 and 10 hours for the buttock skin and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps, respectively.
 Percentage of total area surviving (%TAS) in those flaps which did survive was adversely affected by increases in the ischemic interval in both flap models.
 A statistically significant decrease in percentage of total area surviving was found after 6 and 8 hours of ischemia for the buttock skin and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps, respectively.
