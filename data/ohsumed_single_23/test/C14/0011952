Doxazosin in the treatment of mild or moderate essential hypertension: an echocardiographic study.
 Sixteen patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension received 1 to 8 mg/day of doxazosin (mean daily dose, 2.7 mg).
 Blood pressure reduction (supine and standing) was highly significant (p less than 0.001), and no significant changes in heart rate were observed.
 A significant reduction (p less than 0.01) in left ventricular mass was seen without a change in left ventricular systolic function.
 All side effects were mild, and only one patient withdrew from the study.
