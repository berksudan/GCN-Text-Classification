Doxazosin in the treatment of essential hypertension in general medical practice in Latin America.
 This Latin American study assessed in the general practice setting the efficacy and tolerance of once-daily doxazosin in the treatment of mild or moderate essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure, 95 to 115 mm Hg).
 Patients (n = 220) were treated with doxazosin for 12 weeks as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.
 At the final visit, doxazosin produced a mean change in sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure of -18.4/-14.4 mm Hg, at a mean daily dose of 4.3 mg.
 One hundred sixty-three (77.6%) of the 210 evaluable patients were considered a therapeutic success.
 Lipid analyses identified a statistically significant (p = 0.02) reduction in total serum cholesterol (4.85%) and an overall decrease in triglyceride levels (5.12%).
 According to the Framingham Heart Study equation, doxazosin produced a highly significant (p less than 0.001) 20% reduction in the calculated probability of developing coronary heart disease in 10 years.
 Of the 220 patients evaluated, 54 (24.5%) reported side effects that were considered related to treatment.
 Ten (4.5%) patients reported side effects unrelated to treatment and 37 (16.8%) reported events of unknown relationship.
 Most side effects were mild or moderate and were tolerated or disappeared with continued treatment.
 Nine patients (4.1%) were discontinued from therapy and in 13 (5.9%) the dose was reduced.
 The most prevalent side effects were headache and dizziness.
 The investigator's overall assessment of antihypertensive efficacy was excellent or good for 176 patients (80.4%); tolerance was considered excellent or good in 193 patients (88.5%).
