The role of protein kinase C and calcium in the regulation of norepinephrine release from the vascular adrenergic neurons in hypertension.
 This study was designed to investigate the role of protein kinase C and calcium in vascular adrenergic transmission in hypertension.
 In perfused mesenteric vasculatures of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 7 to 10 weeks old) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), we have examined the effects of the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 on endogenous norepinephrine release and vascular responsiveness during nerve stimulation.
 Endogenous norepinephrine release and pressor responses during periarterial nerve stimulation were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY.
 The protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 inhibited the stimulation-induced norepinephrine release and pressor responses in a dose-dependent manner.
 The magnitude of these suppressive responses were more pronounced in SHR than in WKY.
 Calcium removal from extracellular fluid also reduced the norepinephrine release more strongly in SHR than in WKY.
 These results demonstrate that the regulation of norepinephrine release might be more dependent on protein kinase C and calcium in the blood vessels of SHR, which could contribute, at least partially, to the pathogenesis of this form of hypertension.
