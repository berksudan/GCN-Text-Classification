Degenerative aortic stenosis. One effect of the graying of America.
 Degenerative calcific aortic stenosis is evolving as a common geriatric problem.
 Once symptoms develop, it is a highly lethal disease that does not respond well to medical therapy.
 Aortic balloon valvuloplasty may offer palliation but is unlikely to alter the overall course of the disease.
 Aortic valve replacement is the therapy of choice, but high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates can be expected in the very elderly.
 The presence of other appreciable cardiac disorders may contribute to the occurrence of postoperative complications.
 Patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis and normal left ventricular function can be treated medically and followed with serial aortic valve area determinations using Doppler echocardiography.
