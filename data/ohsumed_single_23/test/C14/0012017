On the inheritance of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 To determine the mode of inheritance of abdominal aortic aneurysm, data on first-degree relatives of 91 probands were collected.
 Results of segregation analysis performed on these data are reported.
 Many models, including nongenetic and genetic models, were compared using likelihood methods.
 The nongenetic model was rejected; statistically significant evidence in favor of a genetic model was found.
 Among the many genetic models compared, the most parsimonious genetic model was that susceptibility to abdominal aortic aneurysm is determined by a recessive gene at an autosomal diallelic major locus.
 A multifactorial component in addition to the major locus does not increase the likelihood of the data significantly.
