Longitudinal dissociation of atrioventricular accessory pathways.
 Unusual properties of atrioventricular (AV) accessory pathways were found during electrophysiologic investigations in four patients (three men and one woman).
 Anterograde longitudinal dissociation of the accessory pathway was observed in two patients and retrograde longitudinal dissociation in two others.
 Two patients had an accessory pathway with a slow conduction time, one in anterograde direction and one in retrograde direction.
 These observations further expand our knowledge of the spectrum of electrophysiologic properties of accessory AV pathways.
