Subarachnoid hemorrhage from a dissecting aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery. Case report.
 A case of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from a dissecting aneurysm of the inferior limb of the middle cerebral artery is reported.
 The patient's clinical status and the initial and follow-up angiographic appearance of the aneurysm are presented.
 Diagnosis and treatment are briefly discussed.
 It is suggested that, if angiography demonstrates luminal narrowing or vascular occlusion in a patient with unexplained SAH, a dissecting aneurysm of the carotid system should be considered as a cause of the hemorrhage.
