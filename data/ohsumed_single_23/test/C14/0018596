Serological arguments for classifying Raynaud's phenomenon as idiopathic.
 Twenty-five patients with idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon were followed prospectively for a mean period of 48 months.
 Clinical and laboratory assessments were performed on admission and on followup.
 The sera were analyzed for the presence of autoantibodies (antinuclear, antiskeleton and antiorganelle antibodies).
 Sixteen patients were antinuclear antibody positive and 2 anticentromere antibody positive.
 Eight patients produced antivimentin, 5 antimitochondrial, 4 anti-Golgi complex, and 3 anticentriol antibodies.
 Eleven patients produced antidesmosome antibodies.
 Only one patient (anti-RNP and antidesmosome antibody positive) developed a systemic disease (mixed connective tissue disease) during followup.
 The initial screening of sera may help to classify Raynaud's phenomenon as idiopathic more accurately.
