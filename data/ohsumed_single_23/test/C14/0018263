Cyclosporine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy resulting in renal allograft loss and its successful reuse: a report of two cases.
 Cyclosporine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy is a rare complication of renal transplantation.
 It commonly leads to graft loss.
 The mechanism of this entity is unknown.
 Factors intrinsic to the donor kidney appear to play an important role.
 We describe two cases of renal transplant patients who lost their first grafts secondary to cyclosporine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy.
 These patients were successfully retransplanted with an immunosuppressive protocol that included long-term cyclosporine.
 We conclude that graft loss from this entity is not a contraindication to subsequent successful transplantation with cyclosporine.
