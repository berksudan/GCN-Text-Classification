Myocardial imaging with Tc-99m teboroxime: technique and initial results.
 This study examined the results of Tc-99m teboroxime imaging in 22 patients aged 59 +/- 9 years and compared the results with those of thallium-201.
 The exercise and rest teboroxime studies were obtained within 3 hours of each other using a dose of 15 mCi/study.
 Because of the very short wash-out half-life of teboroxime, imaging was begun within 1 to 2 minutes after injection.
 Both SPECT and planar images were obtained; the SPECT protocol was modified by changing the number of frames, the time per frame, or the filters used for reconstruction of images.
 The planar images were obtained in the supine or upright position.
 Shorter acquisition time for SPECT (10 sec/frame) and the use of a Butterworth filter with a frequency cutoff of 0.3 cycle/cm and a power of 10 yielded best image quality.
 There was a close agreement with thallium results in identifying an abnormal or normal perfusion pattern in 89% of vascular territories.
 The scans were abnormal by both techniques in 12 patients, normal in nine patients, and discordant in only one patient.
 Thus Tc-99m teboroxime myocardial imaging is feasible at rest and during exercise using either SPECT or planar imaging.
 Shorter acquisition time and appropriate filtering for SPECT imaging and the upright position in planar imaging improve image quality and are convenient for the patient.
