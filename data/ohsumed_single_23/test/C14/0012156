Alternative technique for repair of sinus venosus atrial septal defect.
 A technique is described for closure of a sinus venosus atrial septal defect using a single patch held in place by sutures placed from outside the right atrium and underneath the superior vena cava.
 The superior vena cava does not require enlargement and potential damage to the artery to the sinoatrial node is avoided.
