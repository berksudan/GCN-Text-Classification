Increased whole blood viscosity combined with decreased erythrocyte fluidity in untreated patients with essential hypertension.
 Erythrocyte fluidity and other haemorheological variables were studied in 22 patients with essential hypertension and compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
 Hypertensive patients displayed a significantly lower erythrocyte fluidity (P less than 0.001).
 Similarly, significantly elevated values for haematocrit, plasma and whole blood viscosity, as well as aggregation tendency were observed compared to controls.
 Although differing in these respects from controls, there were no obvious relationships between these rheological variables and either systolic or diastolic blood pressure.
 The significantly lower erythrocyte fluidity and other changes in haemorheological variables of red blood cells found in hypertensive patients may be explained by an enlarged metabolic pool of free calcium ions in these red blood cells.
 It is suggested that the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of essential hypertension are multifactorial rather than being based on a single molecular derangement.
 Primary events resulting in altered physicochemical properties of the red blood cells may work in concert in the development of essential hypertension, in addition to the increased availability of calcium ions and their potential role in smooth muscle contraction.
