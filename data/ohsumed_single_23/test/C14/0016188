Early scintigraphic detection of experimental myocardial infarction in dogs with technetium-99m-glucaric acid 
 Recent data have generated some interest in technetium-99m-(99mTc) glucaric acid as an in vivo viability marker.
 We studied 99mTc-glucaric acid retention in canine models of myocardial ischemia (20-min occlusion of the LAD/40-min reperfusion), acute myocardial infarction (MI) (90-min LAD occlusion/3-hr reperfusion), and chronic MI (90-min occlusion and either 48-hr or 10-day reperfusion).
 Regional myocardial blood flow was measured by radiolabeled microspheres.
 No preferential uptake of glucaric acid was observed in ischemic but viable myocardium.
 The compound showed high affinity for necrotic myocardial tissue for several days following injury.
 The preferential uptake in infarcted tissue disappeared by 10 days following injury.
 This study shows that 99mTc-glucaric acid acts exclusively as a marker of necrosis in canine models of MI.
 Technetium-99m-glucaric acid may have clinical utility in early cardiac imaging of myocardial infarction and in differentiating recent from old injuries.
