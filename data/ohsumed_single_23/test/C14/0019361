Patient age and results of balloon aortic valvuloplasty: the Mansfield Scientific Registry experience. The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators.
 Patients enrolled in the Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry were followed up a mean of 7 months after balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
 Results were compared for patients less than 70, 70 to 79 and greater than or equal to 80 years of age at time of valvuloplasty.
 As assessed by aortic valve area indexed to body surface area, stenosis was more severe in the older patients and the incidence of congestive heart failure was also greater in those aged greater than or equal to 80 years.
 The results of valvuloplasty were comparable in all three age groups, and indexed final valve area was not significantly different among the groups.
 In-hospital mortality ranged from 4.2% to 9.4%, but this and other complications were not significantly different among the groups.
 Total 7 month mortality was 23%.
 As performed in this registry study, balloon aortic valvuloplasty produced similar results in older and younger patients, despite initially more severe disease in the older patients.
