Sodium-potassium interaction in hypertension and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.
 Epidemiological evidence suggests that low potassium intake is associated with the probability of occurrence of hypertension and stroke.
 The short-term response to increased potassium intake is increased sodium excretion as well as increased potassium excretion; the short-term response to increased sodium intake is increased potassium excretion as well as increased sodium excretion.
 In some experimental studies, increased amounts of potassium have been able to block the noxious influences of sodium.
 Sodium and potassium must be concomitantly considered in the investigation of the association of either of these cations with hypertension and cardiovascular disease.
 The chloride ion is also important for sodium's effects; its importance in potassium's effects has not been extensively explored.
