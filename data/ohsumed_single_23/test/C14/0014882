Coronary stent implantation in acute vessel closure 48 hours after an unsatisfactory coronary angioplasty.
 We report the implantation of a balloon-expandable stent in a patient with acute vessel closure in the state of evolving myocardial infarction following 48 hr after unsatisfactory coronary angioplasty.
 The stent was implanted after successful recanalization of an occluded left anterior descending artery, with repeated unsatisfactory results of balloon angioplasty.
 Adjunct thrombolytic therapy was contraindicated.
 No residual stenosis was documented in immediate control angiograms, or after 24 hr, 3 weeks, and 4 months.
