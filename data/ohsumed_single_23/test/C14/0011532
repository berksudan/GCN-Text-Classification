Association between post-dexamethasone cortisol level and blood pressure in depressed inpatients.
 We examined the clinical data for 230 depressed inpatients who had completed a dexamethasone suppression test (DST) to determine whether those with an elevated post-DST serum cortisol level exhibited any of the classic physiological stigmata of Cushing's syndrome.
 Hypertension was significantly more frequent among DST nonsuppressors (21.2%) than among normal suppressors (11.3%).
 Percent blood lymphocyte count was significantly lower among nonsuppressors.
 Confounders such as gender, age, body weight, and use of antihypertensives did not account for the findings.
 Implications for morbidity and mortality rates among patients with affective disorder are discussed.
