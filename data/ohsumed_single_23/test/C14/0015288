Comparative clinical pharmacology of calcium channel blockers.
 Calcium channel blockers are effective antihypertensive agents, both as initial monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensive agents.
 These drugs are also effective in the treatment of chronic, stable angina, variant angina and supraventricular arrhythmias.
 Drugs in this class have different affinities for calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, cardiac sinus and atrioventricular node.
 They are all useful in hypertension and angina, but only verapamil and diltiazem are also useful in the control of heart rate and supraventricular arrhythmias.
 Nimodipine may control vascular spasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 Calcium channel blockers have also been used in the treatment of migraine headache and Raynaud's phenomenon.
