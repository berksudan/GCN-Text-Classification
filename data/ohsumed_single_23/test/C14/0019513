The mechanism of heart failure caused by cardiac allograft rejection.
 Rejection of the cardiac allograft is often associated with reversible myocardial failure, the mechanism of which is not understood.
 We have examined this phenomenon in a small animal model that provides the opportunity for multimodality study of the rejection process.
 Heterotopic cardiac transplantation was performed in the Lewis rat with Lewis X Brown-Norway (allografts) or Lewis (isografts) donors.
 Without immunosuppression, allografts are completely rejected in 6 to 8 days.
 At 3 days cardiac grafts were explanted and mounted on a modified Langendorff apparatus for functional measurements or submitted for pathologic examination and biochemical determination of high-energy phosphates.
 Three-day isografts (n = 9) had minimal histologic changes.
 Pathologic examination of 3-day allografts (n = 13) showed lymphocytic infiltrate and myocyte necrosis, histologic features for which antirejection treatment is usually given clinically.
 For grafts subjected to functional studies (n = 11), heart rate, cardiac output, coronary flow, and stroke work were determined at baseline and in response to isoproterenol (3 x 10(-8) mol/ml).
 Three-day allografts (n = 6) and isografts (n = 5) had similar baseline function.
 The chronotropic response to isoproterenol was similar in allografts and isografts, but allografts had diminished cardiac output and stroke work after isoproterenol.
 Adenosine triphosphate levels were normal (41.9 nmol/mg) in 3-day allografts (n = 4).
 We have evaluated functional, biochemical, and pathologic changes associated with myocardial dysfunction during heterotopic cardiac transplant rejection in a small animal.
 This model reproducibly demonstrates diminished contractile reserve in 3-day allografts with normal baseline function and high-energy stores but histologically significant rejection.
