Pulse rate, coronary heart disease, and death: the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study.
 To determine whether associations of elevated resting pulse rate with CHD incidence or death in white men are independent of other risk factors and whether such associations exist for women and blacks, data were examined from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study.
 Over a follow-up period of 6 to 13 years, elevated RR for CHD incidence were found for older white men with baseline pulse greater than 84 beats/min compared with less than 74 beats/min after controlling multiple risk factors (RR = 1.37, 95% CL 1.02, 1.84).
 Risks of death from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, and noncardiovascular diseases were also elevated for white men with elevated pulse rate independent of other risk factors.
 CHD incidence was increased in white women with elevated pulse rate.
 Risks of death from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, and noncardiovascular diseases, were also elevated for white men with elevated pulse rate independent of other risk factors.
 CHD incidence was increased in white women with elevated pulse rate.
 Risk of death from all causes and cardiovascular diseases was elevated in black men and women with elevated pulse rate.
 Risk of death from noncardiovascular disease was elevated in black men with elevated pulse rate.
 The association with cardiovascular death was particularly striking in black women, even after adjusting for baseline risk factors (RR 3.03, 95% CL 1.46, 6.28).
 Further studies are needed to assess associations of pulse rate with CHD in blacks and to elucidate mechanisms in all groups.
