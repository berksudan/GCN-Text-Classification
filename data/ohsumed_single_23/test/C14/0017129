Effects of standing on the induction of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
 To evaluate the effects of standing on induction of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, electrophysiologic studies were performed in both the supine and standing positions in 22 patients with atrioventricular (AV) reciprocating tachycardia and in 11 with AV node reentrant tachycardia.
 AV reciprocating tachycardia was induced in 9 of the 22 patients with AV reciprocating tachycardia when they were in the supine position and in 17 when standing.
 The effective refractory period of the AV node markedly shortened, from 275 +/- 72 to 203 +/- 30 ms (n = 16, p less than 0.005) after standing.
 The effective refractory period of the accessory pathway shortened slightly, from 293 +/- 75 to 278 +/- 77 ms (n = 8, p less than 0.005), after standing.
 AV node reentrant tachycardia was induced in 3 of the 11 patients with AV node reentrant tachycardia when they were in the supine position and in 6 when standing.
 The effective refractory periods of the slow pathway and fast pathway shortened markedly, from 293 +/- 72 to 216 +/- 40 ms (n = 6, p less than 0.025) and from 416 +/- 85 to 277 +/- 50 ms (n = 10, p less than 0.005), respectively, after standing.
 Plasma norepinephrine levels increased during standing both in patients with AV reciprocating and in those with AV node reentrant tachycardia (n = 11, p less than 0.005, n = 8, p less than 0.005, respectively).
 In conclusion, standing, which is associated with increased sympathetic tone, changed the electrophysiologic properties of the reentrant circuits, facilitating induction of AV reciprocating tachycardia and AV node reentrant tachycardia.
