Home blood pressure readings in borderline hypertensive patients.
 Home blood pressure monitoring can provide valuable information for physicians managing borderline hypertensive patients.
 This study was conducted to compare office and home blood pressures in 36 borderline hypertensive subjects, and to determine the accuracy of the home monitoring unit used.
 The patients were very willing to record their home blood pressures for an extended period of time.
 The home blood pressure monitors were found to be quite accurate, and blood pressures measured at home were significantly lower than readings obtained in the office.
 In 39% (14 of 36) of the subjects studied, the average home blood pressures were more than 10 mmHg lower than their office readings.
 These findings support the hypothesis that home blood pressure monitoring can be useful in the management of borderline hypertensive patients.
