Revascularization of an ischemic limb by use of a muscle pedicle flap: a rabbit model.
 A rabbit model of hind limb ischemia was designed to demonstrate that new, hemodynamically significant arterial connections will develop between ischemic skeletal muscle and an independently perfused muscle pedicle flap.
 The right common iliac artery was divided in 15 rabbits.
 In eight rabbits a muscle flap based on the left deep inferior epigastric artery was transposed to the right thigh (flap group).
 In seven rabbits a sham operation was performed where the flap was sutured to the abdominal wall (sham group).
 After 7 days angiography demonstrated arterial connections between the flap and the native limb circulation in all of the flap group animals.
 The flap increased muscle perfusion in the ischemic limb (2.99 ml/100 gm muscle/minute in the flap group, vs 2.06 ml/100 gm muscle/minute in the sham group, p less than 0.005).
 Hemodynamically significant vascular connections will develop between a well-perfused muscle flap and an ischemic limb.
 The augmentation in perfusion provided by these connections can be quantified.
