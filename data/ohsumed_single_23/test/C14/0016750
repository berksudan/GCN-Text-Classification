Sudden appearance of coronary thrombus observed by angiography--a case report.
 A sudden coronary thrombus formation was documented by chance during cardiac catheterization in a patient with postinfarction angina.
 The thrombus was successfully treated with intravenous urokinase and heparin infusions, and thereafter, coronary angioplasty was performed without any complication.
