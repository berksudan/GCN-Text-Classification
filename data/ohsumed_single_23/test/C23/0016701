Acetazolamide in the treatment of abnormal oculovestibular response.
 We treated seven patients with incapacitating vertigo elicited by walking down a grocery store aisle or driving a car.
 Results of neurologic, neuro-ophthalmic, and neuroradiologic examinations were normal.
 Episodic vertigo secondary to an abnormal oculovestibular response was diagnosed.
 Each patient was given a trial of 250 to 500 mg of acetazolamide daily.
 Symptoms resolved completely in four patients, two patients had near resolution of symptoms, and one patient had no relief.
 Carbonic anhydrase activity has been demonstrated in the inner ear, and acetazolamide has been shown to affect the ion balance of the inner ear fluids.
