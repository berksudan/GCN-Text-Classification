Decision criteria for pure-tone detection used by two age groups of normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners.
 Response criteria from a yes-no task and detection thresholds from two test procedures were measured for four groups of adults: younger normal-hearing, older normal-hearing, younger hearing-impaired, and older hearing-impaired.
 The two test procedures were an audiological procedure (which does not control for response bias) and a 21FC adaptive procedure (which does control for bias).
 The signal was a 500 or 4000 Hz tone presented in quiet.
 All four groups showed an equally conservative response bias in the yes-no task.
 In addition, neither age nor hearing loss affected the difference (6.5 dB) between the two threshold measures.
