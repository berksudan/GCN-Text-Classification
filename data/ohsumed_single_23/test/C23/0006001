Mitral valve prolapse: comparison of diagnosis by physical examination and echocardiography 
 To determine how well physical examination findings suggestive of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) correlate with echocardiographic evidence of MVP, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 104 patients referred to an Air Force Cardiology Clinic for echocardiography to rule out MVP.
 In each case, the referring physician's specialty and his findings on cardiac physical examination were recorded.
 All patients had M-mode echocardiography, and half of the patients had two-dimensional echocardiography.
 Sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios for the physical examination were calculated using echocardiography as the comparison standard.
 The combination of a systolic click and a systolic murmur was the physical examination finding most predictive of echocardiographic MVP, with a positive likelihood ratio of 2.43.
 Other combinations of physical findings yielded likelihood ratios close to 1.
 No differences were found based on the specialty of the examining physician.
 We conclude that when practicing physicians find a systolic click and murmur, MVP is likely to be present on echocardiography, though one third of the patients will have normal echocardiograms.
 Other combinations of physical findings are of little help in predicting echocardiographic MVP.
