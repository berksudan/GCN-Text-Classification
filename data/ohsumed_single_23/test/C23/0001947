Comparison of lymphatic and venous interpositional autografts in experimental microsurgery of the canine lymphatics.
 In mongrel dogs, 56 autologous lymphatic and vein grafts were interpositioned to bridge a defect in the femoral collecting lymphatics.
 In one group, 26 lymphatic autografts were interpositioned with good results.
 No obstruction was observed over 6 months.
 In another group, 20 venous autografts were interpositioned after irrigation with heparinized saline and another 10 autografts were interpositioned without irrigation.
 After 1 week, four irrigated grafts were partially occluded with a red thrombus; after 6 months, all grafts were totally occluded.
 In a third group, 15 lymphaticolymphatic anastomoses were enveloped by a silicone sheet to provoke prolonged devascularization.
 None of the vessels was patent.
 Anastomotic patency was inspected in vivo postoperatively.
 The specimens were studied with light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy.
 Prolonged devascularization damaged the endothelial cells.
 The results show that the lymphatic vessel autograft is the best choice for an interpositional autografting to bridge a defect in lymphatic vessels.
