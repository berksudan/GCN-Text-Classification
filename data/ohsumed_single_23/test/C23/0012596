Living arrangements and sources of caregiving.
 This study examined both the prevalence of different types of caregivers (in terms of the relation to the individual), and whether living with someone is more important for caregiving than the relation of an elder to an individual.
 Caregiving is examined in terms of IADL and emotional support.
 Analyses are conducted using three separate random samples of those who are married and living with a spouse, those who live alone, and those who live with nonspousal others in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
 The results confirm previous research pointing out that married people tend to receive assistance from their spouse.
 Among nonmarrieds, children are named most frequently as the primary caregiver.
 After children, however, those who live alone tend to receive assistance from friends, and those who live with nonspousal others receive assistance from siblings.
 The data further document the importance of the structural characteristic of living with someone, rather than marital status, for assistance with IADL.
