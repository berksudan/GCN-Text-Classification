Treatment of advanced-stage massive mediastinal Hodgkin's disease: the case for combined modality treatment.
 In the initial series of 198 patients treated at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, a review of presenting chest radiographs available on 192 of these patients showed 49 patients with mediastinal masses greater than one third the greatest posteroanterior chest diameter.
 Five patients had stage IIB disease, and 44 had stage III or IV disease.
 Thirty-five (71%) patients achieved a complete remission with MOPP chemotherapy.
 Fourteen (40%) of the complete responders relapsed, but four of these achieved durable remissions in response to subsequent therapy.
 Thirty (61%) patients have died (14 induction failures, nine relapsed patients, seven complete responders in remission).
 Thus, with a median follow-up of 20 years (range, 15 to 23), the overall survival for the group is 39%, and the disease-free survival for the complete responders is 60%.
 A subset of 10 patients received mantle radiation therapy after maximal response to MOPP.
 One of these patients failed to achieve complete remission, but among the nine complete responders only one has relapsed.
 In contrast, 13 of 26 (50%) patients achieving a complete response to MOPP alone have relapsed (P2 = .0536).
 Although MOPP alone was not prospectively compared with MOPP plus radiation therapy in the treatment of advanced-stage massive mediastinal Hodgkin's disease in this series, the retrospective analysis shows a nearly significant difference in disease-free survival favoring combined modality treatment.
 The difference in tumor mortality between MOPP-treated (44%) and combined modality-treated patients (80%) was also nearly significant (P2 = .055).
 However, overall survival differences between patients treated with MOPP alone and those treated with combined modality therapy were not significantly different (P2 = 0.23) because of the mortality related to late complications of combined modality treatment.
