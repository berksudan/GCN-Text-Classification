Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy.
 Cholecystectomy remains the most effective form of therapy for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis.
 An alternative method of gallbladder removal, laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy, was attempted in 100 patients.
 Five patients required conversion of the laparoscopic procedure to an open laparotomy for the following reasons: discovery of a pancreatic malignancy in one patient, extensive adhesions in one, presence of an aberrant accessory right hepatic duct in one, common hepatic duct injury in one, and avulsion of the cystic duct in one.
 Both ductal injuries occurred during the early phase of the clinical program.
 In those patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 93 were discharged within 24 hours of surgery and 94 returned to normal activity within 1 week.
 Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy appears to offer a number of advantages in patient care as well as a significant reduction in health care expenses for gallbladder disease.
 Appropriate training in laparoscopic surgery is necessary in order to avoid operative complications.
