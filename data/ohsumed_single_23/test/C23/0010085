Effects of topical glaucoma drugs on fistulized rabbit conjunctiva.
 Conjunctival fibroblastic proliferation with contracting scar formation has been implicated as a possible cause of glaucoma filtering surgery failure.
 The effects of glaucoma medications on bulbar conjunctiva were evaluated in both eyes of 20 pigmented rabbits, with 5 rabbits per group each receiving singular topically applied daily doses of either 0.5% timolol, 1% epinephrine, 4% pilocarpine, or artificial tears in a masked fashion for 4 months.
 Posterior lip sclerectomies were performed in 16 rabbits--4 from each treatment group.
 The remaining four rabbits served as nonsurgical controls.
 Four additional rabbits, which had not received eye drops, were included as a nonmedicated control group, with one rabbit serving as a nonsurgical control.
 Immunostaining was performed to identify the presence of myofibroblasts in fistulized conjunctiva.
 Treated surgical eyes, regardless of medication, had higher myofibroblastic cell proliferation than treated nonsurgical eyes.
 Among fistulized eyes, all medications increased cell proliferation, with pilocarpine eliciting the most dramatic increase compared with all other groups.
