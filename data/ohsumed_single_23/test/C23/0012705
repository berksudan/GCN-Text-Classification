Large telangiectatic focal nodular hyperplasia presenting with normal radionuclide studies: case report.
 A 9 cm-lesion of telangiectatic focal nodular hyperplasia was incidentally identified in a 31-yr-old female.
 Despite a typical appearance by X-ray computed tomography and ultrasonography, scintigraphy with technetium-99m-(99mTc) colloid, 99mTc-diethyliminodiacetic acid, and 99mTc-labeled red cells failed to demonstrate any abnormalities.
 These findings are felt to reflect the relative lack of architectural disruption that histologically characterizes this particular lesion.
 The present report described the imaging characteristics of the telangiectatic form of focal nodular hyperplasia.
