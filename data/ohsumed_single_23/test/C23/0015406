Patient-controlled analgesia in children.
 We report our experience in introducing patient-controlled analgesia at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow.
 Twenty-five children used the technique after orthopaedic or general surgery using the Graseby system.
 The pump was loaded with 1 mg/kg morphine sulphate in 50 ml.
 A bolus dose of 0.02 mg/kg (1 ml) and a lockout interval of 10 minutes were the initial settings.
 The dose used, pain and sedation scores, respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded.
 Ages ranged from 5-15 years (mean 9.6) and the method was used for a mean of 48 hours after operation.
 Morphine requirements averaged 26 (micrograms/kg)/hour (SD 10.6).
 Pain control was good and sedation minimal.
 Adverse effects were few and minor.
 Education of patients, parents and nurses is essential for its success and safety.
 The technique is an effective and safe means of providing good quality analgesia in school age children.
