Quality of life in elderly, chronically ill outpatients.
 Quality of life (QL) in elderly outpatients is poorly characterized.
 We interviewed 258 elderly outpatients from three health care settings to identify the attributes and events that affect self-assessment of QL.
 These outpatients rated their QL as acceptable, citing medical care, health, interpersonal relationships, financial status, and functional status as affecting their QL.
 Overall QL ratings were not strongly associated with objective indicators such as demographic characteristics and use of health care services.
 Subjective indicators, including patient perceptions of health, memory, and financial concerns, were correlated independently with global QL (sigma R2 = .35).
 We conclude that older, chronically ill patients generally consider their QL to be acceptable and affected by a variety of factors, including their perceptions of their emotional, socioeconomic, intellectual, and physical functioning.
 Furthermore, QL is poorly associated with objective indicators.
 Thus, in assessing the QL of elderly, chronically ill outpatients, physicians should elicit information regarding these perceptions.
