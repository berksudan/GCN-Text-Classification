Abdominal wall reconstruction (the "mutton chop" flap).
 Reconstruction of full-thickness abdominal wall defects can be a difficult surgical challenge.
 Reconstructing the epigastrium may be especially vexing.
 The use of prosthetic mesh has significant drawbacks, and the use of pedicled myofascial and myocutaneous flaps should be advantageous.
 We present 15 consecutive cases demonstrating highly successful reconstructions of massive abdominal wall defects using myofascial and myocutaneous flaps without prosthetic mesh.
 The extended rectus femoris flap, or "mutton chop" flap, which is capable of resurfacing the epigastrium, is described.
 Complications were minimal, and use of myofascial units, particularly the rectus femoris, should be considered as the technique of choice for reconstruction of major abdominal wall deficits.
