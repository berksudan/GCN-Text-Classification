Reactions of first-year medical students to their initial encounter with a cadaver in the dissecting room.
 This study reports the results of a 1986 questionnaire survey of 100 first-year medical students regarding their preparation for and reactions to their first encounter with a human cadaver in the dissecting room.
 The students were aware of psychological and physical reactions to this experience, and although they felt adequately prepared prior to the class, expressed a desire for greater preparation afterwards, particularly through more discussion of the experience with the anatomy staff.
 A surprising number of the students (62) had had prior exposure to a dead human body, which was a significant influence upon their reactions.
 The results of this study suggest a need for improving both the preparation for coping with dissection and the follow-up opportunities for dealing with professional and emotional issues raised during human dissection.
