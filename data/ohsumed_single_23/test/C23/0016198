Delayed positive gastrointestinal bleeding studies with technetium-99m-red blood cells: utility of a second injection.
 Two patients studied with technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells (RBCs) for gastrointestinal bleeding had positive findings only on 24-hr delayed images, at which time the site of bleeding could not be ascertained.
 In each instance, when additional delayed images suggested that active bleeding was occurring, a second aliquot of RBCs was labeled and injected.
 Sites of active hemorrhage were identified following further imaging in both patients.
 When delayed GI bleeding images are positive, further views should be obtained to ascertain if the pattern of intraluminal activity changes.
 If renewed active hemorrhage is suspected, reinjection with a second dose of labeled RBCs may identify the bleeding site.
