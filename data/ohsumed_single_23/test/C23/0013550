Chronic hypomagnesemia caused by cisplatin: effect of calcitriol.
 A group of six patients with hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium less than or equal to 0.5 mmol/L), previously given treatment with cisplatin for ovarian or testicular cancer, received calcitriol at a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 microgram/day for a period of 4 weeks to determine whether treatment with this vitamin D metabolite could improve their hypomagnesemia.
 In response to treatment, the serum magnesium concentration fell progressively in association with a rise in serum and urinary calcium levels and a decrease in parathyroid hormone level.
 In a single previous report, active vitamin D metabolites markedly improved renal magnesium wasting.
 However, in the present study, increases in serum and urinary calcium levels and suppression of parathyroid hormone, factors known to decrease magnesium reabsorption, presumably overwhelmed any direct effect calcitriol may have had to enhance magnesium reabsorption, so that the net effect was a marked exacerbation of the renal magnesium wasting.
