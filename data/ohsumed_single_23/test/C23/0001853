Down-regulation of a calmodulin-related gene during transformation of human mammary epithelial cells.
 A human cDNA library obtained from cultured normal mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) was searched by subtractive hybridization for genes whose decrease in expression might be relevant to epithelial transformation.
 One clone identified by this procedure corresponded to a 1.4-kilobase mRNA, designated NB-1, whose expression was decreased greater than 50-fold in HMECs tumorigenically transformed in vitro after exposure to benzo[a]pyrene and Kirsten sarcoma virus.
 Sequence analysis of NB-1 cDNA revealed an open reading frame with a high degree of homology to calmodulin.
 NB-1 expression could be demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction amplification in normal breast, prostate, cervix, and epidermal tissues.
 The presence of NB-1 transcripts was variable in primary breast carcinoma tissues and undetectable in tumor-derived cell lines of breast, prostate, or other origins.
 NB-1 mRNA expression could be down-regulated in cultured HMECs by exposure to reconstituted extracellular matrix material, while exposure to transforming growth factor type beta increased its relative abundance.
 The protein encoded by NB-1 may have Ca2+ binding properties and perform functions similar to those of authentic calmodulin.
 Its possible roles in differentiation and/or suppression of tumorigenicity in epithelial tissues remain to be examined.
