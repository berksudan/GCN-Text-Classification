Application of microwave tissue coagulation in partial nephrectomy.
 Microwave tissue coagulation was used during partial nephrectomy in 10 mongrel dogs, without clamping the renal artery.
 There were no major complications, such as retroperitoneal hematoma, abscess formation, or macroscopic infarction of the kidney tissue related to this new procedure.
 The advantages of microwave coagulation are reduced blood loss, shorter operative time, and minimal risk of vascular injury.
