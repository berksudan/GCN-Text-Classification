Nuclear techniques for the analysis of urinary calculi.
 Sections of urinary calculi were prepared and point-by-point analyses along a line-scan were carried out using the techniques of proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA).
 Correlations between several pairs of elements (including trace elements) were noted and it was also clear that the composition of a stone varied markedly at different stages of development.
