Use of the calcium agonist BAY K 8644 for in vitro diagnosis of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia.
 We have studied the effects of the calcium agonist BAY K 8644 on the in vitro halothane test in 10 malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (MHS), 12 MH "equivocal" to halothane (MHEh), 30 MH non-susceptible (MHN) and 10 control patients.
 BAY K 8644 potentiated the halothane-induced contracture in muscle strips from both MHS and MHEh patients.
 The drug produced a more obvious difference in contracture responses between the MHEh group compared with the MHN and control groups.
