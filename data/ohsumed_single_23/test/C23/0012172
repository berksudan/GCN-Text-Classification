Might free arterial grafts fail due to spasm?
 The rat femoral artery was used as a free graft and was studied after 2, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days.
 The patency of the grafts was 100% (2 days, n = 6), 78% (7 days, n = 9), 63% (14 days, n = 8), 33% (30 days, n = 12), and 18% (60 days, n = 11).
 Histology showed an intimal thickening after 14 days and the media, which in the controls consisted of eight to ten layers of myocytes, was reduced to six to eight cell layers.
 During the first 2 weeks the graft segments had an impaired contraction when exposed to Krebs solution with 124 mmol/L K+, whereas after 1 month and later the graft segments approached the controls or had even higher contractile force.
 The thromboxane mimic U-46619 elicited full contractile force at all times whereas the potency was significantly lower during the first 14 days.
 Noradrenaline was unable to induce contraction in the graft segments during the first 14 days, but at 30 and 60 days it had regained full contractile force and was significantly more potent (approximately 60 times) in the graft segments compared with the controls.
 This study suggests that intimal thickening and hypercontractility might be a problem in free muscular arterial grafts.
