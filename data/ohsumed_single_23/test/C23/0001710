Clomiphene citrate stimulation as an adjunct in locating ovarian tissue in ovarian remnant syndrome.
 Ovarian remnant syndrome results from residual ovarian tissue after bilateral oophorectomy.
 The syndrome is associated with chronic pelvic pain and is suspected when premenopausal levels of FSH and LH are present in a patient with documented bilateral oophorectomy.
 Histologic demonstration of ovarian tissue at operation confirms the diagnosis.
 We treated a patient with ovarian remnant syndrome with a 10-day course of clomiphene citrate, 100 mg daily, to stimulate the residual ovarian tissue and facilitate localization.
 Preoperative ultrasound revealed a 5.0 x 3.5 x 6.2-cm cystic mass in the right adnexal region.
 Exploratory laparotomy easily localized the mass, and it was removed intact.
 Histologic slides demonstrated normal ovarian tissue with multiple follicles in various stages of development and a corpus luteum cyst.
 Clomiphene citrate is capable of stimulating an ovarian remnant, producing an enlarged, cystic structure easily localized by ultrasound.
 The increased size and preoperative knowledge of the location facilitated surgical removal.
