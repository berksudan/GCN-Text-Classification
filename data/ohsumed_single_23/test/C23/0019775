Factitious cyclic hypersomnia: a new variant of factitious disorder.
 The central goal of patients with factitious disorders is to receive medical care.
 Unnecessary diagnostic procedures and recurrent hospitalizations often ensue.
 We saw a 39-year-old man with a novel variation of this disorder: factitious cyclic hypersomnia, or the simulation of recurrent episodes of excessive sleep.
 This case highlights the observations that patients whose illnesses are simulated may have diverse symptoms, that no syndrome is immune to factitious imitation, and that attempts at treatment, though exceedingly challenging, are always contingent upon appropriate recognition.
