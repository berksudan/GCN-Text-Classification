A blinded comparison of noninvasive, in vivo phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the in vitro halothane/caffeine contracture test in the evaluation of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.
 Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal, anesthetic-induced syndrome.
 Currently, the only accurate means of diagnosing susceptibility to this syndrome is the testing of biopsied skeletal muscle for its contracture response to halothane and caffeine.
 A less invasive means of diagnosis is needed.
 The authors previously reported that MH-susceptible patients studied by in vivo phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy demonstrated a higher resting inorganic phosphate (Pi) to phosphocreatine (PCr) ratio in their skeletal muscle, as well as a slower postexercise recovery of PCr/Pi, when compared to normal controls.
 In the present blinded study, the authors compared in vivo 31P NMR determination of resting Pi/PCr and recovery rate of PCr/Pi in forearm muscles to in vitro halothane/caffeine contracture test results in 42 patients.
 Forty-three control subjects were studied to establish normal NMR values of resting Pi/PCr and recovery rate of PCr/Pi.
 Their findings were compared with those of 27 patients shown to be MH-susceptible and 15 patients MH-negative by contracture testing.
 The MH-susceptible group had a significantly (P less than 0.005) higher resting Pi/PCr value (0.202 +/- 0.044) than either the MH-negative (0.152 +/- 0.043) or the control (0.141 +/- 0.026) group.
 The MH-susceptible group also had a significantly (P less than 0.02) slower postexercise recovery rate of PCr/Pi (1.50 +/- 0.872 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) than either the MH-negative (2.11 +/- 1.07 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) or control (2.25 +/- 0.828 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) group.
 Twenty-six of the 27 MH-susceptible patients demonstrated abnormal NMR test results (a resting Pi/PCr greater than or equal to 0.18 or recovery rate less than 1.0 PCr.Pi-1.min-1), and 13 of the 15 MH-negative patients had normal NMR results.
 Although neither NMR parameter alone was diagnostically reliable, an NMR test utilizing both parameters was quite accurate.
 The NMR test and contracture test demonstrated an overall agreement of 93% with a copositivity of 96% and conegativity of 87%.
 The sensitivity and specificity of the NMR test is estimated to be 98.8% +/- 11.8% and 95.3% +/- 20.3%, respectively.
 The role of 31P NMR in the diagnosis of MH susceptibility and possible mechanisms underlying the observations are discussed.
