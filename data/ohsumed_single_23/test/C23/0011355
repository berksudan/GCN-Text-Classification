Theophylline minimally alters contractile properties of canine diaphragm in vitro.
 We examined the effects of theophylline on contractile properties and high-frequency fatigue of canine diaphragm in vitro.
 Eighteen diaphragm muscle bundles were obtained from 10 anesthetized dogs and equilibrated in oxygenated Krebs solution to 100, 200, or 300 mg/l theophylline.
 These bundles were compared with 18 matched control bundles from the contralateral hemidiaphragm.
 No statistically significant differences in twitch tension, tetanic tension, twitch-to-tetanus ratio, time to peak tension, or half-relaxation time were observed.
 Concentrations of 300 mg/l theophylline, however, significantly (P less than 0.05) increased force production at 10 Hz by 32%.
 A similar tendency was present at lower concentrations and exhibited a clear dose-response behavior.
 High-frequency fatigue was similar in control and theophylline-treated bundles.
 We conclude that supratherapeutic in vitro concentrations of theophylline do not increase maximal tetanic tension and do not protect against muscle fatigue but potentiate relative force production at low stimulation frequencies.
 This relatively small effect cannot be explained by poor diffusion of the drug in the muscle bundle, because theophylline concentrations in the muscle bath and in the muscle bundle were virtually identical.
 Moreover, it remains unclear whether this potentially beneficial effect can be achieved at in vivo attainable serum concentrations.
