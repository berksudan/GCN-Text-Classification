Disordered colorectal motility in intractable constipation following hysterectomy.
 Colorectal and anal sphincter motility and electrophysiology were investigated in 14 women with profound constipation following hysterectomy and compared with an asymptomatic group of control subjects.
 Twelve patients complained of significant urinary symptoms.
 No differences in the motor function of the anal sphincters were detectable.
 The latency of the pudendoanal reflex was unchanged after hysterectomy.
 Proctometrograms demonstrated significantly increased rectal volumes and compliance in the hysterectomy group together with deficits of rectal sensory function.
 In the basal state a significant proximal-to-distal sigmoid colon motility gradient existed only in the control group.
 Following stimulation with Prostigmin, this gradient was enhanced in the control group but paradoxically reversed in the hysterectomized patients, thus constituting a functional obstruction.
 Denervation supersensitivity was demonstrable in two patients tested with carbachol provocation but not in control subjects.
 These findings suggest dysfunction in the autonomic innervation of the hindgut in some patients who had undergone hysterectomy, resulting in severe constipation.
