Cytokine release syndrome induced by the 145-2C11 anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in mice: prevention by high doses of methylprednisolone.
 The hamster mAb 145-2C11 specific for the CD3 complex of murine T lymphocytes shares many properties with OKT3, including the induction of T cell activation.
 In vivo, the injection of 145-2C11 entails a variety of pathologic changes in relation to the systemic release of cytokines.
 We tested the effects on this cytokine release syndrome of different doses of methylprednisolone (m-PDS) given at various intervals of time before the 145-2C11 mAb.
 The administration of high doses of m-PDS (50 mg/kg) 2 to 3 h before the mAb resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the systemic release of TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-6.
 As far as the pathologic changes are concerned, the hypothermia, the acute renal tubular necrosis, and the fatty infiltration of the liver were completely prevented whereas the hypoglycemia was only partially attenuated.
 The protective effect of m-PDS on the toxicity of 145-2C11 was confirmed by the reduction of the mortality rate among galactosamine-sensitized mice.
 The inhibition of the release of cytokines by m-PDS did not affect the immunosuppression triggered by 145-2C11 as assessed by the CTL activity against alloantigens measured 48 h after the injection of the mAb.
 We conclude that the administration of very high doses of glucocorticoids 2 to 3 h before 145-2C11 prevents the release of cytokines and attenuates the acute toxicity of the mAb.
 Similar protocols could allow mitigation of the cytokine-release syndrome induced by the OKT3 mAb in man.
