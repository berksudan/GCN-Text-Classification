Identification and characterization of a regulated promoter element in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene.
 We have identified a 36-base-pair proximal element (-112 to -77 relative to the AUG translation initiation codon) in the epidermal growth factor receptor 5' region that functions as a promoter; mediates inductive responses to epidermal growth factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and cyclic AMP; and acts in an orientation-independent manner.
 This region functions as an enhancer when transferred to a heterologous promoter containing a TATA box.
 Mutations within the 36-base-pair region alter function as assayed by reporter gene expression in recipient cells.
 A protein has been identified that demonstrates appropriate binding specificity to mutant DNA sequences that correlates with promoter activity observed in vivo.
 On the basis of DNA binding characteristics and size, the identified protein appears distinct from several previously identified transcription factors known to bind to G+C-rich regions.
