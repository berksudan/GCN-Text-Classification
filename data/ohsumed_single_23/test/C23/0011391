Clip repair of peripheral side-to-side arteriovenous fistulas. Evaluation of a method in dogs and preliminary results in humans.
 A simple technique for repair of peripheral arteriovenous fistula by clip application is presented.
 This procedure is rapid and effective, it minimizes the extent of dissection, and it eliminates the need for application of vascular clamps on the vessels and for anticoagulation.
 The safety of the procedure was confirmed in dog experiments and clinically applied successfully in four patients.
 It is suitable for simple, uncomplicated side-to-side fistulas amenable to this procedure.
