Intraoperative coronary angiography using fluorescein.
 Intraoperative coronary angiography using fluorescein was applied to evaluate the patency of saphenous vein grafts just after completion of the distal anastomosis.
 By this technique, the area of the revascularized myocardium was well estimated in real time.
 This intraoperative direct-vision examination gives us more timely and precise information during coronary artery bypass grafting.
