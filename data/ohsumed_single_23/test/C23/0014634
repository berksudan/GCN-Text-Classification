Nasal augmentation with split calvarial grafts in Orientals.
 This study reports on my experience with autogenous split calvarial grafts in nasal augmentation in 62 Orientals.
 In 78 percent of patients, the procedure was performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting.
 Total operating time for harvesting of split calvarial grafts ranged from 20 to 55 minutes, with a mean of 32 minutes.
 Patients ranged in age from 16 to 48 years, with a mean of 27 years.
 Follow-up was from 6 months to 8 years, with an average of 3.1 years.
 Intraoperative discomfort was uniformly low and well tolerated when local anesthesia was used.
 The complication rate was 8.0 percent, with three cases of minor seroma-hematoma formation at the bone-graft donor site.
 These were treated with aspiration.
 There were two recipient-site complications, with one case of complete bone resorption that occurred in a densely fibrotic nose with preexisting septal perforation and a case of overcorrection that was successfully rasped 1 year later.
 Because of their easy accessibility beneath the scalp, split calvarial grafts to the nose are useful in various types of nasal augmentation, and the technique is offered as a practical alternative to the use of alloplastic materials.
