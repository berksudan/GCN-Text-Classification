Molecular evolution of inversions in Drosophila pseudoobscura: the amylase gene region.
 The amylase region of the third chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura has been cloned and localized to cytological band 73A.
 It is contained within a series of highly polymorphic inversions and serves as a convenient tool for a molecular evolutionary analysis of the inverted gene arrangements.
 Amylase in D.
 pseudoobscura is a family of three genes, and some chromosomes have deletions for one or two of them.
 Two overlapping clones covering 26 kilobases were isolated and used as probes to survey DNA restriction map polymorphism among 28 lines, representing five of the major inversion types found in natural populations, as well as single chromosomes from the closely related species Drosophila persimilis and Drosophila miranda.
 Restriction-site differences are considerably greater among the various gene arrangements than among chromosomes with the same gene arrangement.
 Clustering the restriction map haplotypes yielded a dendrogram concordant with the phylogeny generated independently from cytogenetic considerations.
 The inversion polymorphism is estimated to be about 2 million years old.
