Stage transitions in B-lymphocyte differentiation correlate with limited variations in nuclear proteins.
 Total nuclear proteins extracted from cell lines representing various stages of differentiation of mouse B lymphocytes were studied by computer analysis of two-dimensional gels.
 Of the 1438 spots present on the gels, 55 varied significantly in intensity during differentiation.
 The variations occurred most often in steps correlating with those classically defined for B-cell differentiation.
 Seventeen spots were not detectable in at least one of the stages (qualitative variations) and could represent switching on or off of genes coding for nuclear proteins.
 Detailed analysis of the 55 variable spots showed that they fall into small sets characterized by similar expression profiles, which argues for a combinatorial, multistep control mechanism of gene expression.
 In addition, analysis of the expression of all the nuclear proteins resolved on the gels clearly differentiated B-lineage cells from myeloid cells and suggested that the most important transition in B-cell differentiation occurs between the resting B cell and plasmocyte stages.
