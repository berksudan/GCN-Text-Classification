Peritoneal closure or non-closure at cesarean.
 The value of peritoneal closure at the time of cesarean birth was evaluated prospectively.
 Two hundred forty-eight women undergoing low transverse cesarean through a Pfannenstiel skin incision were assigned to one of two groups: peritoneum open (N = 127) or peritoneum closed (N = 121).
 The mean (+/- SEM) surgical time in the open group (48.1 +/- 1.2 minutes) was significantly less than for the closed group (53.2 +/- 1.4 minutes) (P less than .005).
 There were no postoperative differences between the groups in the incidence of wound infection, dehiscence, endometritis, ileus, and length of hospital stay.
 Our study suggests that leaving the parietal peritoneum unsutured is an acceptable way to manage patients at cesarean delivery.
