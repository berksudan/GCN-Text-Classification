A variant of arteriovenous fistulas within the wall of dural sinuses. Results of combined surgical and endovascular therapy.
 Dural arteriovenous (AV) fistulas are thought to be acquired lesions that form in an area of thrombosis within a sinus.
 If the sinus remains completely thrombosed, venous drainage from these lesions occurs through cortical veins, or, if the sinus is open, venous drainage is usually into the involved sinus.
 Among 105 patients with dural AV fistulas evaluated over the the past 5 years, seven had a unique type of dural AV fistula in the superior sagittal, transverse, or straight sinus in which only cortical venous drainage occurred despite a patent involved sinus; the fistula was located within the wall of a patent dural sinus, but outflow was not into the involved sinus.
 This variant of dural AV fistulas puts the patient at serious risk for hemorrhage or neurological dysfunction caused by venous hypertension.
 Three patients presented with hemorrhage, one with progressive neurological dysfunction, one with seizures, and two with bruit and headaches.
 A combination of surgical and endovascular techniques was used to close the fistula while preserving flow through the sinus.
