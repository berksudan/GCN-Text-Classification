Trans-scleral application of a semiconductor diode laser.
 We used a diode laser with an output power of 1 W through a fiberoptic light pipe (200 microns diameter) to deliver laser energy through the sclera of pigmented rabbits.
 Ciliary body destruction occurred with energy levels of 300-400 mW and exposure time of 0.5 sec.
 Retinal photocoagulation was achieved with energy levels of 200-500 mW in 0.5 sec.
 Histologic examination of acute lesions demonstrated thermal destruction of ciliary body processes and retina.
 Chorioretinal scar formation was observed clinically and histologically within 2-3 weeks.
 Our data indicate that the transscleral diode laser may be used for destruction of the ciliary body processes or peripheral retinal coagulation in pigmented eyes.
