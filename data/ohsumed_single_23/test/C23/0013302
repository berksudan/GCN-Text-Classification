The deoxyribonucleic acid regions involved in the hormonal regulation of thyroglobulin gene expression.
 Transcription of the thyroglobulin (TG) gene is stimulated by TSH via cAMP.
 We have characterized the sequence elements responsible for the hormone-dependent expression of TG gene in rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells using internal deletion and linker-scanning mutants of the minimal TG promoter (-170 basepairs) fused with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene.
 The TG gene is regulated by at least two regions located between -165 and -140 bp (TG-III) and between -95 and -65 bp (TG-I) from the transcription initiation site.
 The intervening region can be deleted without significant effect on the promoter activity.
 Either of the two regions alone does not promote hormone-dependent transcription.
 A DNase footprinting assay showed that TG-I and TG-III are the principal protein-binding sites and that the proteins interacting with these two regions are induced by TSH or cAMP.
 These results suggest that the hormone-dependent expression of TG gene may be achieved by cooperative interaction of the proteins bound to TG-I and TG-III.
