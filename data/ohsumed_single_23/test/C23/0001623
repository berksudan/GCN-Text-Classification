Cortical tremor: a variant of cortical reflex myoclonus.
 Two patients with action tremor that was thought to originate in the cerebral cortex showed fine shivering-like finger twitching provoked mainly by action and posture.
 Surface EMG showed relatively rhythmic discharge at a rate of about 9 Hz, which resembled essential tremor.
 However, electrophysiologic studies revealed giant somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with enhanced long-loop reflex and premovement cortical spike by the jerk-locked averaging method.
 Treatment with beta-blocker showed no effect, but anticonvulsants such as clonazepam, valproate, and primidone were effective to suppress the tremor and the amplitude of SEPs.
 We call this involuntary movement "cortical tremor," which is in fact a variant of cortical reflex myoclonus.
