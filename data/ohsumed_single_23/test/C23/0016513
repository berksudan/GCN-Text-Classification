A prospective study of patients with sciatica. A comparison between conservatively treated patients and patients who have undergone operation, Part II: Results after one year follow-up.
 The prospective study included 122 sciatica patients who had not undergone operation (NOPs) and 220 sciatica patients who had undergone operation (OPs); all had been examined by rhizography.
 The follow-up study was done on 110 (90%) of the NOPs and 212 (96%) of the OPs.
 The NOPs were divided into two groups: 30 patients with pathologic rhizography (PR) and 80 patients with negative rhizography (NR).
 Pain-, ADL-, and occupation-handicap indices showed that after the 1 year follow-up the OP group had the best result and the NR group the lowest result.
 The PR group had nearly as good a result as the OP group.
 Thus, sciatica patients are candidates for conservative therapy, even though they have pathologic findings in rhizography, if the symptoms are mild.
 To improve therapeutic outcome, more accurate diagnostic tools are needed to develop specific therapy especially for those sciatica patients with negative rhizography.
