An angiographic technique for three-dimensional determination of arterial supply patterns in cadaver soft tissue.
 A method for arterial tree mapping that can be used in cadaver soft tissue is presented.
 In situ angiograms and photographs are supplemented with profile angiograms of relatively narrow bands of tissue from the removed specimen.
 The described method was better suited for mapping the course and supply patterns of a soft-tissue arterial network than either in situ angiograms or dissection.
 While practical problems were encountered with most of the solutions used for providing radiopacity or structural support to the vessels, pure barium sulfate was found to be suitable because it filled the vascular tree to the capillary level without leakage during excision of the specimen.
