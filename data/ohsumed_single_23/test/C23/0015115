Outpatient orthognathic surgery: criteria and a review of cases.
 Over a 9-year period, 87 orthognathic procedures were performed in an outpatient environment.
 Procedures performed included horizontal mandibular osteotomies, rapid palatal expansions, bilateral sagittal split osteotomies, posterior and anterior maxillary osteotomies, and Le Fort I osteotomies.
 Fourteen of these patients were subsequently admitted to a hospital for either observation or full inpatient care.
 The rates of admission varied for each of the procedures, with length of anesthesia statistically related to the frequency of admission.
 Patient selection criteria and facilities used are reviewed.
