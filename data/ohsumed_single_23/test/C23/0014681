Reoperation for biliary strictures.
 Benign bile duct strictures most often follow intraoperative injury not recognized until later.
 The ideal reconstruction entails a mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis without tension, usually with a stent tube to maintain patency in the immediate postoperative period.
 The mortality rate for reoperation and bile duct reconstruction in patients who are not cirrhotic is approximately 2%, and success rates average 85%.
 Prevention of operative injuries by the use of cholangiography, careful dissection, and removal of the gallbladder from the fundus downward is the best treatment.
