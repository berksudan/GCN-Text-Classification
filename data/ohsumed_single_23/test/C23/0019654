Do you have patients with anorexia or bulimia? Understanding is the first step in helping.
 Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa have, in recent years, become disorders of major concern.
 Young women are particularly prone to such eating disorders, and substantial numbers have involved themselves in the practices that identify these problems.
 Understanding the thinking behind these disorders is helpful in recognizing them and developing a treatment approach.
 The most effective medication for bulimia reported to date is fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac).
 The concurrent participation of a physician, nutritionist, and family therapist in the care of these patients is ideal.
