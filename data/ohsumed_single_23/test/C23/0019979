Interruption of professional and home activity after laparoscopic cholecystectomy among French and American patients.
 With a laparoscopic approach, patients can undergo cholecystectomy with a shorter hospitalization, minimal pain, and quicker recovery.
 It has not been demonstrated, however, that patients actually return to work after laparoscopic cholecystectomy faster than the traditional 4- to 6-week absence from work after a standard open procedure.
 A survey of 104 French and 84 American patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy revealed that postoperative discomfort was completely resolved in 2 weeks in 73% of French and 93% of American patients.
 All but 11 French and 5 American patients were back to normal home activities by 2 weeks after the operation.
 Of the 35 American and 40 French patients who had professional activity outside the home, 63% and 25%, respectively, returned to work within 14 days.
 Five (14%) of the American patients and 12 (30%) of the French patients returned to work 4 weeks or more after the operation.
 The amount of physical activity on the job correlated with the period off work, but, interestingly, at least six patients with very hard physical activity at work (including construction workers) were able to return to full work activity within 1 week.
 These data suggest that early return to work is possible and that pain resolves quickly after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 The economic benefit of having patients back on the job quickly, however, may be less than expected until cultural norms change with regard to leave of absence after major surgery.
