Sympathetic neural adjustments to stress in physically trained and untrained humans.
 The purpose of this study was to determine if the state of physical training influences sympathetic neural activation during acute stress in humans.
 We recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography of the peroneal nerve), arterial blood pressure, and heart rate in 12 highly trained, endurance athletes (25 +/- 1 years, mean +/- SEM) and 12 untrained subjects (27 +/- 1 years) before (supine rest control) and during: 1) lower body negative pressure at -5, -10, -15, and -20 mm Hg (orthostatic stress); 2) isometric handgrip at 30% of maximum (exercise stress); and 3) hand immersion in ice water, that is, the cold pressor test (thermal stress).
 Body weight was not different in the two groups, but the athletes had a lower body fat content (8.9 +/- 1.3% versus 16.1 +/- 2.0%, p less than 0.05).
 During supine rest, muscle sympathetic nerve burst frequency (24 +/- 3 versus 24 +/- 2 bursts/min, athletes versus untrained subjects) and burst incidence (36 +/- 3 versus 44 +/- 4 bursts/100 heart beats) and arterial blood pressure were not different in the two groups, but heart rate was lower in the athletes (54 +/- 2 versus 67 +/- 3 beats/min, p less than 0.05).
