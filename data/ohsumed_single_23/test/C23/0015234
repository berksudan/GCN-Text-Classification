Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: report of 82 cases.
 In our initial experience with 82 patients, laparoscopic cholecystectomy has shown numerous advantages over open cholecystectomy.
 Both intraoperative blood loss and postoperative need for pain medication have been minimal.
 Most patients were discharged within 24 to 36 hours and resumed normal activities within 3 to 5 days.
 The aesthetic aspect is also an obvious advantage, since the laparoscopic procedure avoids disfiguring abdominal scars.
 Previous abdominal surgery is not a contraindication to attempting this procedure.
 Based on our experience, laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done safely on most patients who are candidates for open cholecystectomy, including the elderly, the obese, and those with acute gangrenous cholecystitis.
