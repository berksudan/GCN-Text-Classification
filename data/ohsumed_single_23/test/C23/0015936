Micromotion of cemented and uncemented femoral components.
 We evaluated the initial stability of cemented and uncemented femoral components within the femoral canals of cadaver femurs during simulated single limb stance and stair climbing.
 Both types were very stable in simulated single limb stance (maximum micromotion of 42 microns for cemented and 30 microns for uncemented components).
 However, in simulated stair climbing, the cemented components were much more stable than the uncemented components (76 microns as against 280 microns).
 There was also greater variation in the stability of uncemented components in simulated stair climbing, with two of the seven components moving 200 microns or more.
 Future implant designs should aim to improve the initial stability of cementless femoral components under torsional loads; this should improve the chances of bony ingrowth.
