Control of immediate postoperative pain with topical bupivacaine hydrochloride for laparoscopic Falope ring tubal ligation.
 Conflicting reports exist in the literature on the effectiveness of topical local anesthetic applied to the serosal surface of the fallopian tubes for the control of immediate postoperative pain after mechanical (band or clip) tubal ligation.
 Sixty-four patients were studied prospectively during outpatient laparoscopic Falope ring tubal ligation using the modified McGill Present Pain Intensity Scale.
 Patients randomly assigned to four groups received topical bupivacaine hydrochloride on both fallopian tubes, the right tube only, or the left tube only, or received none (controls).
 A unique study design was incorporated which allowed the untreated fallopian tube to serve as a within-subject control for each patient receiving unilateral treatment.
 Statistical analysis confirmed significant benefit when both fallopian tubes were treated as compared with no treatment (P less than .05).
 There was also consistent evidence of decreased immediate postoperative pain perception on the treated side for patients receiving unilateral treatment.
 The value of topical bupivacaine was demonstrated by both subjective patient response (McGill Pain Scale) and reduced need for pain medication before outpatient discharge.
 Our data support the value of topical bupivacaine applied to the serosal surface of the fallopian tubes for the reduction of postoperative pain after outpatient laparoscopic mechanical (band or clip) tubal ligation.
