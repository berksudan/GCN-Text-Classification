An improved technique for development of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap.
 The pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is the most commonly employed muscle skin transfer used in soft-tissue reconstruction of defects of the upper neck and jaw region.
 This article presents conceptual and technical changes in the development of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap that preserve a greater vascular pedicle and enhance the flap's arc of rotation.
 Data from 54 consecutive cases using this modified approach show a reduction in complications, a greater range of use, and consistent healing in radiated and nonradiated tissues without requiring sectioning or removing the clavicle or causing significant chest deformities.
 These modifications have produced a more predictable transfer compared with other reported techniques.
