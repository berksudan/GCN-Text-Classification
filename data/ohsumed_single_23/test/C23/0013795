Death and functional outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. A prospective study of 166 cases using multivariate analysis 
 Using death and functional status as end points, we prospectively analyzed the outcome 6 months after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in 166 patients admitted to an acute-care stroke unit on the first day of their stroke.
 Seventy-one patients (43%) died, 69 (42%) had a satisfactory outcome, and 26 (16%) had a poor functional outcome.
 Early (30-day) survival was correlated with morphologic parameters on the initial computed tomogram (hemorrhage size, midline shift, and intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage), while later (6-month) survival was correlated with age.
 Using logistic regression, we found five independent predictors of satisfactory outcome at 6 months: age, hemorrhage size, intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage, limb paresis, and communication disorders.
 Of these, age was the most important predictor by far.
