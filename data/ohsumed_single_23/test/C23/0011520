Sudden cardiac death during exercise in a weight lifter using anabolic androgenic steroids: pathological and toxicological findings.
 A 21-year-old, previously healthy weight lifter collapsed during a bench press workout.
 He had taken anabolic androgenic steroids parenterally for the previous several months.
 Pertinent autopsy findings included marked cardiac and renal hypertrophy and hepatosplenomegaly, with regional myocardial fibrosis and focal myocardial necrosis.
 Nandrolone (19-nor-testosterone) metabolites were identified in postmortem urine.
 The possible etiologies of the cardiac findings are discussed.
