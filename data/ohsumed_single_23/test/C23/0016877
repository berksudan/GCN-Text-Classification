Anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury following femoral artery reconstructive surgery.
 Two cases are presented exhibiting symptoms and signs of bilateral anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury, clinically sparing femoral nerve branches to the saphenous nerve and quadriceps muscles.
 This occurred following surgical dissection in the femoral triangles associated with femoral artery reconstructive surgery.
 Anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury should be considered when anterior medial thigh pain and numbness occur following aortofemoral bypass graft surgery and other types of femoral artery reconstructive surgery.
