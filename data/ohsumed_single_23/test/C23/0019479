Subclavian artery to innominate vein fistula after insertion of a hemodialysis catheter.
 Insertion of hemodialysis catheters for temporary use is now preferentially performed by percutaneous infraclavicular subclavian vein catheterization.
 This method involves passage of a stiff dilator and a peel-away sheath over a guide wire, and is usually carried out without fluoroscopy.
 For the most part this has proved to be a valuable and safe approach.
 However, a small incidence of major complications occurs, which needs to be emphasized.
 Sixteen cases of arteriovenous fistulas between the subclavian artery or its branches and the subclavian vein have been reported so far in the literature.
 To date only one case of subclavian artery to innominate vein fistula has been reported.
 We report the second case with this complication and suggest possible preventive measures.
