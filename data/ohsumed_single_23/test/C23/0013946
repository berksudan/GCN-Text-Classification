Nocturnal faecal soiling and anal masturbation.
 Two cases of late onset faecal soiling as a result of anal masturbation in children who were neither mentally handicapped nor psychotic were studied.
 The role of soiling in aiding the young person and his family to avoid separating and maturing is highlighted.
 We suggest that the association of anal masturbation and resistant nocturnal soiling may be unrecognised.
