Studies of controlled reperfusion after ischemia. XXII. Reperfusate composition: effects of leukocyte depletion of blood and blood cardioplegic reperfusates after acute coronary occlusion.
 OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the role of leukocyte depletion during initial reoxygenation with normal blood and blood cardioplegic reperfusates in limiting reperfusion damage.
 METHODS: Twenty-eight dogs underwent 2 hours of ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery.
 The initial reperfusate (37 degrees C) was delivered on total vented bypass to the left anterior descending artery by a calibrated pump via an internal mammary artery graft at 50 mm Hg for 20 minutes.
 Eight dogs received normal (normokalemic, nonenriched) blood reperfusion (leukocyte count 8000/mm3) and six were reperfused with leukocyte-depleted normal blood (leukocyte count less than 100/mm3).
 Of 14 dogs reperfused with substrate-enriched (hyperkalemic) blood cardioplegic solution, six received a cardioplegic solution with a leukocyte count less than 100/mm3.
 RESULTS: Leukocyte depletion of normal blood reduced reperfusion-induced arrhythmias from 63% to 17% (p less than 0.05).
 Coronary vascular resistance at initial reperfusion was low and remained low during substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic reperfusion with both normal and reduced leukocyte counts.
 In contrast, coronary vascular resistance rose 63% with normal blood reperfusion, and this increase was avoided by leukocyte depletion (2.6 versus 4.0 mm Hg x ml/min, p less than 0.05).
 Coronary vascular resistance after 20 minutes was, however, higher than that with blood cardioplegia with normal or decreased leukocyte counts.
 Negligible functional recovery followed reperfusion with normal blood and leukocyte-depleted blood (12% and 6% of control systolic shortening).
 In contrast, substantial segmental recovery followed blood cardioplegic reperfusion (73% systolic shortening, p less than 0.05) but was not improved by leukopheresis (81% systolic shortening).
 Leukocyte depletion of normal blood reperfusate reduced histochemical damage from 53% to 38% (p less than 0.05), but the least histochemical damage followed blood cardioplegic reperfusion with a normal or reduced leukocyte count (8% or 11%, p less than 0.05).
 CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an important role for leukocytes in reperfusion damage, but reperfusate leukocyte filtration alone is inferior to blood cardioplegic reperfusion.
 Leukocyte depletion of blood cardioplegic solutions seems unnecessary after only 2 hours of ischemia.
