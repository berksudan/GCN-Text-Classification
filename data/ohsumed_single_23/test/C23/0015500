Memory retraining to support educational reintegration.
 A memory retraining package specifically designed to facilitate reintegration of head injured patients into an educational environment is described.
 Two adolescent patients who had severe head injuries were administered the memory retraining package approximately three months postinjury.
 A single case study and multiple baseline design was used to evaluate the efficacy of the memory retraining program.
 The results suggested that this is a promising avenue for improving memory functioning and facilitating educational reintegration, but only where moderate rather than severe memory deficits are involved.
 Studies involving groups of patients and the collection of data on generalization are required to confirm usefulness.
