The effect of flunarizine on essential tremor.
 We investigated the effect of flunarizine treatment (10 mg/d) in 17 subjects with essential tremor in a double-blind placebo-controlled design.
 Tremor was assessed by clinical scoring, tremographic recordings, and subjective rating by subjects.
 Of the 15 subjects who completed the study, 13 showed improvement.
 We conclude that flunarizine is effective treatment for essential tremor.
