The Dutch experience in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of narrowed saphenous veins used for aortocoronary arterial bypass.
 Of 19,994 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures performed in The Netherlands between April 1980 and January 1989, the long-term follow-up of 454 patients who underwent angioplasty of greater than or equal to 1 saphenous vein bypass graft was reviewed.
 In 46% of patients single graft angioplasty was attempted, and in 54% of patients sequential graft angioplasty was attempted.
 The clinical primary success rate was 90%.
 In-hospital mortality was 0.7%, 2.8% of patients sustained a procedural myocardial infarction, and 1.3% of patients underwent emergency bypass surgery.
 After a follow-up period of 5 years, 74% of patients were alive, and 26% were alive and event-free (no myocardial infarction, no repeat bypass surgery or repeat angioplasty).
 In patients in whom the initial angioplasty attempt was unsuccessful, only 3% were event-free at 5 years, versus 27% of successfully dilated patients.
 The time interval between the angioplasty attempt and previous surgery was a significant predictor for 5-year event-free survival.
 The event-free survival rates for patients who had bypass surgery 1 year before, between 1 and 5 years, and 5 years before angioplasty, were 45, 25 and 19%, respectively.
 Less than one-third of patients with previous bypass surgery who had angioplasty of the graft remained event-free after 5 years.
 In patients needing angioplasty within 1 year after bypass surgery, better long-term results were achieved.
