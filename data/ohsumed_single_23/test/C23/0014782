Long-term results of Ionescu-Shiley valve in the tricuspid position.
 A retrospective analysis of the long-term results of using the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial bioprosthesis in the tricuspid position was carried out on 73 patients (8 men, 65 women).
 Of these procedures, ten were tricuspid valve replacement alone and the remainder were in combination with other valve procedures.
 The mean follow-up was 9.6 years (range, 4 to 18 years).
 The mean age of the patients was 53 years (range, 27 to 78 years).
 Seventy-one of the patients suffered tricuspid valve dysfunction from rheumatic heart disease.
 There were 13 postoperative deaths (within 30 days), giving a mortality rate of 17.8%.
 The actuarial survival at 10 years was 71% +/- 4.2%.
 Of the survivors, 49 (79.6%) were in functional class I or II.
 Primary tissue valve failure in the tricuspid position occurred in 1 patient 12 years after implantation and required reoperation.
 In another patient bioprosthetic tricuspid valve endocarditis developed.
 There was no incidence of thromboembolic complications.
 We conclude that the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial bioprosthesis was a satisfactory prosthesis in the tricuspid position in patients with acquired valvar dysfunction.
