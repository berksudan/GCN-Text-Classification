Sciatic nerve monitoring during revision total hip arthroplasty.
 This study presents a simple method of intraoperative sciatic nerve monitoring during revision total hip arthroplasty (THA), utilizing intraoperative, somatosensory evoked potentials.
 Using this method, the sciatic nerve was protected when surgical correction of shortened limb length was necessary during revision THA.
 Twenty-three revision THAs were performed using intraoperative sciatic nerve monitoring.
 No postoperative peripheral nerve complications occurred, with an average increase of 18 mm in leg length, ranging from 6 mm to 43 mm.
