Observations on the effect of chimeric anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody in patients with mycosis fungoides.
 Chimeric (murine/human) anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody was infused into seven patients with mycosis fungoides.
 Successive patients received doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg of antibody twice a week for 3 consecutive weeks.
 All patients had some clinical improvement, but responses were of relatively short duration.
 Serum levels of chimeric antibody varied as a function of dose.
 At the 80-mg dose level, antibody was readily observed in biopsied skin lesions.
 Although there was coating by antibody of most CD4 positive cells in the blood, there was no significant depletion of CD4 positive cells.
 Low-level antibody responses against the mouse Ig variable region and human Ig allotypic constant region determinants were observed in several patients, but none were of clinical significance.
 All but two patients made primary antibody and T-cell proliferative responses to a simultaneously administered foreign protein test antigen.
 However, there was marked suppression of the mixed lymphocyte reaction.
 We conclude that at the dose levels studied, a chimeric anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (1) had some clinical efficacy against mycosis fungoides; (2) was well tolerated; (3) had a low level of immunogenicity; (4) had immediate immunosuppressive effects; and (5) did not induce tolerance to a co-injected antigen.
