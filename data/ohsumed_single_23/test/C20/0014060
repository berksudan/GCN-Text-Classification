Granulocytic sarcoma.
 Granulocytic sarcoma is a variant presentation of acute myeloblastic leukemia, occurring in extramedullary locations.
 It is uncommon, but it may occur at any site and at any age, which necessitates its inclusion in the differential diagnosis of all undifferentiated tumors.
 Histology, touch-imprint cytology, cytochemistry, immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy, and molecular studies all contribute to the diagnosis.
