Epidemiology of pediatric HIV infection.
 Perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to increase.
 In 1989 alone, it is estimated that 1750 infected children were born in the United States.
 Although transmission is spreading to areas outside the cities originally most affected, these cities continue to bear the greatest toll.
 Adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to HIV infection; education and counseling are critical for controlling the epidemic in this age group.
