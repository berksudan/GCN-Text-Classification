Detection of early human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I antibody patterns during seroconversion among transfusion recipients.
 From a cohort of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) exposed transfusion recipients (N = 71) enrolled in the Jamaican Transfusion Study, 11 were selected for detailed laboratory evaluation.
 All recipients were followed at monthly intervals for 6 months and then bimonthly up to 1 year for evidence of HTLV-I seroconversion.
 Without regard to results on screening assays, pretransfusion and posttransfusion samples were tested with two licensed HTLV-1 whole-virus screening enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), recombinant EIAs for antibody against tax (p40x) and p21e envelope, standard whole virus Western blot (WB), WB enhanced with recombinant p21e, and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA).
 In the early period posttransfusion, antibody to gag core protein was predominant with anti-p24 generally appearing before anti-p19.
 Recombinant anti-p21e envelope protein, in EIA and WB format, was frequently the earliest envelope reactivity detected, while anti-gp46 in WB and anti-gp61/68 in RIPA system appeared later.
 Anti-tax antibodies appeared later in the time course of seroconversion.
 The whole-virus EIAs were less sensitive than the confirmatory assays.
 The combination of WB and RIPA or WB enhanced with recombinant p21e appeared equally effective in confirming samples as positive by the Public Health Service two gene group confirmatory algorithm.
 However, specificity of this assay approach could not be addressed in this study.
