IgG subclass concentrations in absolute, partial and transient IgA deficiency in childhood.
 Sixty-seven children with symptomatic IgA deficiency were studied on two separate occasions.
 Eighteen had aIgAd at presentation, and 49 had pIgAd.
 IgA concentrations had risen to the normal range for age in 22.2% of children presenting with aIgAd and 77.6% presenting with pIgAd when restudied at a median interval of 3.2 and 3.0 years, respectively.
 IgG subclass concentrations were measured by enzyme immunoassay in serum samples collected at enrollment from 12 children with aIgAd and 22 children with pIgAd.
 IgG2 and IgG4 concentrations for these 34 children were below the 5th centile for age and sex more frequently than expected (IgG2: chi square 5.8, P less than 0.025; IgG 4: chi square 18.4, P less than 0.0005).
 The prevalence of IgG2 deficiency or IgG4 deficiency did not differ significantly between those with aIgAd and those with pIgAd.
 IgG2 concentrations remained below the 5th centile more frequently than expected when retested in 31 children whose pIgAd had resolved (chi square 4.6, P less than 0.05).
 Children with aIgAd at presentation had IgG1 and IgG2 concentrations above the 95th centile more frequently than expected (IgG1: chi square 19.7, P less than 0.0005; IgG2: chi square 13.5, P less than 0.001) but this was not seen for IgG3 and IgG4 concentrations.
 Children with pIgAd did not have elevated IgG1 or IgG2 concentrations at presentation.
 High IgG1 and IgG2 concentrations in aIgAd may be a compensatory mechanism to afford protection from infection or could be part of a selective secondary response to repeated episodes of infection.
