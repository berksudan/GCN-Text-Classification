Reactions to iodinated radiographic contrast agents. How to identify and manage patients at risk.
 Systemic adverse reactions to iodinated radiographic contrast material are infrequent but can be dramatic.
 The number of patients experiencing such reactions can be minimized by selecting the most appropriate diagnostic study for each patient and by identifying patients at increased risk.
 Pretreatment with corticosteroids and use of low-osmolality contrast materials can minimize the number of severe reactions in high-risk patients.
