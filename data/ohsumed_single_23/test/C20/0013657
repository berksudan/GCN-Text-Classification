Host defense abnormalities associated with HIV infection.
 Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) impairs immune function.
 Most abnormalities in host defense associated with HIV infection are due to helper T-cell dysfunction.
 Studies defining these abnormalities in the HIV-infected patient have largely been done in adults.
 A more complete understanding of the immunodeficiency that occurs in infants and young children congenitally infected with HIV awaits further study of their immune function and the effect this virus has on the developing immune system.
