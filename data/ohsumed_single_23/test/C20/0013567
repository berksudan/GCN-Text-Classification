Plasma adenosine deaminase2: a marker for human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 Plasma concentrations of the two isoenzymes of adenosine deaminase (ADA, E.C.
 3.5.4.4), adenosine deaminase1 (ADA1) and adenosine deaminase2 (ADA2), were measured in a cohort of ambulatory patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and controls.
 A sensitive isoenzyme-specific radioisotopic assay system was developed for these studies.
 Among 22 HIV-infected patients, plasma ADA2 was significantly elevated as compared with 16 control subjects (p less than 0.01) and 6 uninfected subjects having a risk factor for HIV infection (p less than 0.01).
 Plasma ADA2 was not associated with the stage of disease as defined by clinical status (p greater than 0.05) or helper (CD4) lymphocyte count (p greater than 0.05).
 Available evidence suggests that elevated plasma ADA2 could be a useful surrogate marker for HIV infection that occurs early in the disease process.
