AIDS and pediatric neurology.
 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the etiologic agent of AIDS, causes a wide spectrum of disease in children owing to its selective tropism for the immune system, nervous system, and perhaps other organs.
 By 1991, there may be as many as 10,000 to 15,000 children with symptomatic HIV-1 infection in the United States.
 This article reviews the current knowledge of the clinical, neuroradiologic, and neuropathologic features of HIV-1-related central nervous system involvement in infants and children with symptomatic HIV infection.
