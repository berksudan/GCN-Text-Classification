Primary combined immunodeficiency resulting from defective transcription of multiple T-cell lymphokine genes.
 The circulating T lymphocytes of a female child with recurrent opportunistic infections were normal in number and phenotype but exhibited poor proliferation and decreased synthesis of the T-cell growth factor interleukin (IL) 2 in response to mitogens.
 Recombinant IL-2 fully restored the proliferative responses of her T cells, suggesting that her poor immune function was related to IL-2 deficiency.
 Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA from the patient's T cells revealed markedly decreased levels of IL-2 mRNA of normal size.
 In addition, mRNA levels of other lymphokines selectively expressed by T cells, which include IL-3, IL-4, and IL-5, were either severely depressed or absent.
 The levels of interferon gamma mRNA were moderately decreased, while those of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, a lymphokine the production of which is not restricted to T cells, were unaffected.
 The decreased level of lymphokine mRNA in the patient's T lymphocytes was not from enhanced catabolism but resulted from a diminution in the transcription rate of the affected lymphokine genes.
 Normal transduction via the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex of biochemical signals necessary for the initiation of lymphokine gene transcription indicated that the defect was distal to the membrane signal-transducing apparatus.
 The defect is hypothesized to involve a T-cell-specific trans-acting regulatory factor required for transcription of the affected lymphokine genes.
