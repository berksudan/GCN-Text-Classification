Iopamidol myelography: morbidity in patients with previous intolerance to iodine derivatives.
 The records of 1005 patients who underwent iopamidol myelography between January and September, 1988, were reviewed.
 In this group, 50 patients had histories suggestive of untoward sequelae associated with iodine intake, contact, or administration.
 The charts of these patients were carefully reviewed, and none of them had any reactions or sequelae suggestive of toxicity or an allergic response after iopamidol myelography.
 It is concluded that, even in patients with a previous history suggestive of intolerance to iodine administration, iopamidol myelography is generally a safe procedure.
