Multiple sclerosis in Australia and New Zealand: are the determinants genetic or environmental? 
 The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been recently reported from nine regions of Australia and New Zealand.
 There is a marked variation of prevalence with latitude.
 MS is seven times more common in southern New Zealand than in tropical Queensland.
 On current evidence, it is suggested that in both countries this variation is predominantly due to environmental rather than genetic factors.
