Anaphylactic anaesthetic reactions. The value of paper radioallergosorbent tests for IgE antibodies to muscle relaxants and thiopentone.
 The three currently available paper radioallergosorbent tests ('suxamethonium', alcuronium and thiopentone) were evaluated.
 'Suxamethonium' radioallergosorbent test (which employs choline conjugated to paper discs) proved to be reliable in the detection of allergy to neuromuscular blockers, which were confirmed as the most common cause of anaphylactic reaction during general anaesthesia.
 Thiopentone radioallergosorbent test may also be useful, and is recommended in conjunction with 'suxamethonium' radioallergosorbent test in the preliminary investigation of reactions.
 Patients with positive 'suxamethonium' radioallergosorbent test usually require further testing, including alcuronium radioallergosorbent test, skin testing with a wide range of drug concentrations or leucocyte histamine release test.
