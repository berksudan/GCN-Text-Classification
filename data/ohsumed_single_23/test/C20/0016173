Modern haemophilia treatment: medical improvements and quality of life.
 Adequate replacement therapy in haemophilia has been available for two decades.
 This has led to considerable improvements in the life expectancy and physical status of haemophilia patients.
 A study was conducted to investigate whether this has also led to improvements in quality of life.
 With this aim, information was obtained from 935 Dutch haemophiliacs by mailed questionnaires on relationships, marriage, family life and employment.
 Haemophilia patients were less often married than men in the general population (13% fewer) and had a lower total number of children (30% lower, 17% for those who were married).
 Twenty-two per cent of the patients were not employed and received an income from the disability funds.
 While severity of haemophilia, joint damage and age increased the risk of disability, it was noted that home treatment was associated with a 50% reduction in this risk.
 Remarkably, haemophilia patients did not differ from the general population in their view of the quality of their own health.
 The results of this study show a positive influence of modern haemophilia treatment on quality of life.
 At present, AIDS overshadows all optimistic feelings one may have about this field.
 However, the results described here demonstrate the benefits that can be achieved with adequate replacement therapy, and justify the expectation of further improvements in the near future.
