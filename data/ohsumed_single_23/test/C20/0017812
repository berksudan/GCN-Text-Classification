Individualized aerobic and high intensity training for asthmatic children in an exercise readaptation program. Is training always helpful for better adaptation to exercise?
 In order to define the role of individualized training intensity in a conditioning program for asthmatic children, we have trained seven asthmatics (age = 11.4 +/- 1.8 years) at their ventilatory threshold (VTh) intensity level for a three-month period (aerobic training) and at maximal intensity also for three months (high intensity training).
 VTh is the point at which a nonlinear increase of VE occurs.
 Another group of seven asthmatics (age = 11.4 +/- 1.5) served as control subjects.
 Cardiopulmonary fitness was determined on a cycle ergometer before and after each training session.
 This study demonstrated that aerobic training, correctly adapted to the child's physical ability, induces the following: (1) a rapid and marked cardiovascular fitness increase; and (2) a decrease in VE over a given work range so that VTh is increased.
 This is of great importance because hyperventilation is a major determinant of exercise-induced bronchospasm.
 In contrast, even if high intensity training is well tolerated in an indoor swimming pool, the long-term effects are unsuitable for asthmatic children because the decrease of VTh will involve an increase of hyperventilation, even when exercise is performed at submaximal intensity.
