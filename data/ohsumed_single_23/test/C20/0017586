Relationships between skin prick test, radioallergosorbent test, and chemiluminescent assays in allergic children.
 The results of skin prick tests (SPT), radioallergosorbent tests (RAST), and multiple chemiluminescent tests (DHS-CLA) to grass mix, parietaria, D.
 farinae, and D.
 pteronyssinus were evaluated in 43 allergic children.
 All CLA tests had valid positive and negative control threads.
 Chemiluminescent assays class 4 matched with RAST class 3 and/or 4 and CLA class 3 with RAST class 2.
 The D.
 farinae, D.
 pteronyssinus, and grass results obtained with CLA, RAST, and SPT were investigated by principal components analysis that showed a good association between different methods of measuring allergenicity.
 The results of the present study confirm that DHS-CLA is an effective "in vitro" method for the detection of IgE-allergen specific antibody.
