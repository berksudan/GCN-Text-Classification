Effect of a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist (AA-2414) on bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in subjects with asthma.
 Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to various stimuli is one of the major clinical features of bronchial asthma.
 In this study, the effect of a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonist, AA-2414, on BHR to methacholine was evaluated in 15 patients with asthma.
 The methacholine inhalation test was performed before and after oral administration of AA-2414 for 4 days (20 or 40 mg/day).
 The provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was measured as an index of BHR.
 There was a significant increase in PC20 (p less than 0.01) from 0.43 (geometric SEM, 1.42) mg/ml to 0.93 (geometric SEM, 1.43) mg/ml after 40 mg/day of AA-2414, whereas baseline values of FVC and FEV1 were not changed by the treatment.
 Twenty milligrams per day of AA-2414 did not alter the PC20 value nor the parameter of baseline pulmonary functions.
 These findings might support our hypothesis that the subthreshold concentration of TXA2 in the bronchial tissues, which has no effect on bronchomotor tone per se, may be involved in BHR in asthma.
 Further studies with more potent and specific TXA2 receptor antagonists are needed to confirm the conclusion.
