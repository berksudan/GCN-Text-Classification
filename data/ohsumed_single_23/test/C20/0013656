Laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection.
 Laboratory diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is complicated by absence of data on sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the various tests as they apply to children.
 The presence of maternal anti-HIV passively transmitted across the placenta also confounds diagnosis.
 The authors review currently available data on the detection of HIV, HIV genome, and HIV gene products, as well as the diagnostic value of detecting serologic and cellular responses to HIV in infants and children.
