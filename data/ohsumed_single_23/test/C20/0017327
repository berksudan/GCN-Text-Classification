Studies with RP 56976 (taxotere): a semisynthetic analogue of taxol.
 RP 56976 (taxotere), a new semisynthetic analogue of taxol, is a potentially important chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer.
 We report here that this drug is a potent inhibitor of cell replication and, like taxol, promotes the in vitro assembly of stable microtubules in the absence of guanosine triphosphate and induces microtubule-bundle formation in cells.
 Compared with taxol, RP 56976 is slightly more active as a promoter of tubulin polymerization.
 As an inhibitor of cell replication, RP 56976 is 2.5-fold more potent than taxol in J774.2 and P388 cells and at least 5-fold more potent in taxol-resistant cells.
