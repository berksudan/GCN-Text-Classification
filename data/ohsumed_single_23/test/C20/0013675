Allergenicity of orally administered immunoglobulin preparations in food-allergic children.
 Passive immunization by the oral administration of immunoglobulin preparations derived from bovine milk, chicken egg, and human sera has been proposed as a method for the prevention and treatment of enteric diseases.
 However, the allergenic potential of these proteins may be a factor limiting their widespread use for disease prevention.
 An in vitro study with sera from milk- and egg-allergic children was performed to determine whether these immunoglobulin preparations have allergenic potential.
 Protein extracts of milk, bovine immunoglobulin, egg white, human immune globulin, and five egg yolk antiviral immunoglobulin preparations were bound to nitrocellulose paper.
 These preparations were probed for specific IgE binding with sera from milk- and egg-allergic patients.
 Of 22 milk-hypersensitive patients, 16 had specific IgE binding against the bovine immunoglobulin preparation.
 Of 28 egg-allergic patients 15 had specific IgE binding against one or more of the egg yolk-derived antiviral chicken immunoglobulins.
 Control sera were negative against the milk and egg preparations.
 Western blot analysis confirmed that milk- and egg-allergic patients had IgE-specific antibodies for bovine and chicken immunoglobulin molecules.
 Therefore, the removal of contaminating proteins from milk and egg antibody preparations would be unlikely to eliminate their allergenic potential.
 In contrast, sera from milk- and egg-allergic patients displayed no detectable IgE binding to human immunoglobulin preparations.
 These data indicate that the administration of antibody preparations derived from bovine and chicken sources may lead to severe allergic reactions in milk- or egg-sensitized patients and to sensitization in some nonallergic individuals.
