Travel in eastern Europe. Guidelines for patients.
 Some patients need medical preparation and physician counseling before traveling to eastern European countries.
 In addition to baseline immunizations, a measles booster, a polio booster, typhoid vaccination, and immune globulin prophylaxis against hepatitis A may be indicated.
 Advice should also be given regarding air pollution, contaminated food and water, civil unrest, motor vehicle mishaps, and each country's policy on HIV screening.
 Because the level of healthcare may be poor, contact with American or British embassies or consulates is recommended in an emergency.
