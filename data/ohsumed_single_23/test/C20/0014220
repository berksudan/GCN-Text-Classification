Synergistic action of monoclonal antibodies directed at p55 and p75 chains of the human IL-2-receptor.
 TU27, a mouse IgG1 mAb directed at the p75 chain of the human IL-2R, was analyzed for its ability to interact with IL-2 binding on isolated p75 chains (YT-2C2 cells) and high affinity p55/p75 receptors (human alloreactive T cell clone 4AS), to inhibit IL-2-induced proliferation (4AS cells) and to cooperate with an anti-p55 chain mAb (33B3.1) for inhibiting IL-2 binding and proliferation.
 TU27 and IL-2 bound to the isolated p75 chain expressed by YT-2C2 cells with respective dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.3 and 1 nM.
 They cross-inhibited each other for binding with inhibition constants (Ki) in agreement with their respective Kd values.
 The nature of the interaction was, however, not purely competitive and suggested nonidentical epitopes for the two ligands on the p75 chain.
 On 4AS cells, IL-2 bound with high affinity (Kd = 50 pM) and TU27 with an affinity similar to that found on YT-2C2 cells.
 The binding of TU27 and IL-2 were also mutually exclusive on 4AS cells.
 However, the mechanism of interaction of TU27 with IL-2 was complex since the inhibitory potency of the antibody depended on temperature, antibody preincubation and time of assay.
 Data obtained at 4 degrees C in the presence of suboptimal, tracer-like concentrations of IL-2 indicated that the intrinsic affinity of TU27 for the high affinity configuration was 15-fold lower than for the isolated p75 chain and argued in favor of the affinity-conversion model (as opposed to the preformed complex model) in which p55 and p75 are dissociated in the absence of IL-2.
 At 37 degrees C, TU27 inhibited IL-2 binding only on short time assays (6 min).
 Longer time (30 min) of IL-2 binding resulted in an almost complete disappearance of the effect of TU27, suggesting that internalization of the high affinity p55/p75/IL2 complex enables the cells to escape from the inhibitory effect of TU27.
 In the presence of the 33B3.1 mAb, the interaction of TU27 with IL-2 resembled the one observed on YT-2C2 cells, suggesting that 33B3.1 is able to inhibit the IL-2-induced association of p55 and p75.
 Both antibody were found to synergize on 4AS cells, as a result of a cooperative mechanism in which 33B3.1 blocks the formation of the high affinity complex hence allowing TU27 to bind with higher affinity, and TU27 blocks IL-2 binding to the p75 chain.
 Proliferation studies corroborated the binding experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).
