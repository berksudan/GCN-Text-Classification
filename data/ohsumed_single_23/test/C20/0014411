Miller Fisher syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus.
 We describe the first case of Miller Fisher syndrome, a Guillain Barre variant, complicating systemic lupus erythematosus.
 The symptoms and signs mimicked a brainstem syndrome.
 Despite treatment with high dose gamma globulin, our patient worsened and required mechanical ventilation.
 After plasma exchange, the patient improved.
