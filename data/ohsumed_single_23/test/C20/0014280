HLA and multiple sclerosis in Italy: a review of the literature.
 HLA antigens of locus A, C, B, DR and DQ were typed in 104 Italian multiple sclerosis patients and in 905 healthy controls; the results have been compared with those published in the Italian literature.
 The Italian studies have been reviewed regarding the ethnic origin of the typed population and the corresponding prevalence of the disease.
 The data suggest a lack of association between A3 and B7 antigens and Italian multiple sclerosis and a relevance of other DR locus antigens (mainly DR4 and DR5), in addition to DR2, in the susceptibility to the disease.
