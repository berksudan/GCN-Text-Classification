Behavioral, health and psychosocial factors and risk for HIV infection among sexually active homosexual men: the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.
 We examined whether 644 homosexual men who engaged in receptive anal intercourse were at particularly elevated risk for seroconversion if they also possessed specific behavioral, health or psychosocial vulnerability characteristics.
 Of 11 potential factors examined, heavy drinking, moderate to heavy drug use, and younger age were significantly related to seroconversion.
 These variables were also associated with an increased number of sexual partners, anonymous sex, and failure to use condoms.
