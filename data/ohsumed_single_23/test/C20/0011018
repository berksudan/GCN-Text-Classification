Transition dynamics of HIV disease in a cohort of African prostitutes: a Markov model approach.
 The progression of HIV-related disease from infection to death is represented as a staged Markov model.
 Transitions between stages are considered reversible.
 The model is fitted to data from a cohort of African prostitutes by means of maximum likelihood.
 It appears that the progression to symptomatic disease (Centers for Disease Control stage IV) in this population is considerably more rapid than that reported from studies in Western countries.
