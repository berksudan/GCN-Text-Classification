Immunological changes in primary HIV-1 infection.
 Homosexual men with symptomatic primary HIV-1 infection displayed a pronounced lymphopaenia with significantly depressed numbers of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells and B cells during the first week of illness.
 Subsequently, the CD8+ cell counts rose in parallel with numbers of CD3+ cells, atypical lymphocytes and activated (CD38+ and HLA-Dr+) cells to attain maximal levels about a month following onset of illness.
 In contrast CD4+ and B cell numbers remained low for an extended period of time.
 Early signs of a host response included a transient appearance of interferon-alpha in the blood and raised levels of neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M).
 Neither CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio nor beta 2-M resumed completely normal values during a follow-up period of 2 years.
 These findings shed some light on pathogenetic events during early HIV-1 infection and suggest that the infection, following the acute symptomatic stage, usually enters a stage of chronic active rather than latent infection.
