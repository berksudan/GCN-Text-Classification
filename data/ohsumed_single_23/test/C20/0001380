Decreased number of peripheral blood CD4 + CD29+ lymphocytes and increased in vitro spontaneous production of anti-DNA antibodies in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus.
 Flow cytometric 2-color analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) showed a reduction of relative and absolute number of CD4+ CD29+ cells compared to matched healthy individuals.
 This abnormality was more marked in patients with active/very active disease.
 Absolute number of CD4+ CD29+ cells was negatively correlated with spontaneous anti-DNA Ig production that we demonstrated to be a laboratory index strongly correlated with a clinical disease activity score.
 A decrease of the percentage of CD8+ CD29+ lymphocytes in patients with active disease was also observed.
