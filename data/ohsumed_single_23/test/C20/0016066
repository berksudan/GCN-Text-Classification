Food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis: a study on 11 Japanese cases.
 Eleven patients with food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis were studied.
 Seven patients experienced anaphylactic symptoms only after eating certain foods, such as shellfish, wheat, and grape before exercise.
 In the remaining four patients, no specific food could be identified, but the act of eating itself predisposed to anaphylaxis.
 Their anaphylactic symptoms were all clearly distinguished from cholinergic urticaria by history.
 Patients who developed anaphylactic symptoms before 20 years of age (N = 7) were atopic themselves or had atopic first-degree relatives.
 Six patients had increased serum IgE levels, and IgE antibodies against the causative food allergens were detected by the skin prick test or RAST in four cases.
 In contrast, patients who developed the symptoms after 30 years of age (N = 4) appeared to have a less atopic background, and IgE levels were within normal range except in one case.
 Three of four patients in the latter group developed symptoms after ingesting food made of wheat followed by exercise.
 All patients were sensitive to wheat as determined by the skin prick test.
 In six of 11 patients, a considerable rise in plasma histamine concentration was observed after exercise challenge with treadmill alone, and food intake followed by exercise induced a further increase in one patient.
