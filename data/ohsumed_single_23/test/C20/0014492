Common variable immunodeficiency: the disorder and treatment.
 A case of common variable immunodeficiency, a relatively rare disorder, is presented.
 This case was complicated by the presence of an anti-IgA antibody in the patient's serum and a history of a possible anaphylactic reaction to a prior intravenous infusion of gamma-globulin.
 Common variable immunodeficiency is actually a heterogeneous group of demonstrable immunoglobulin deficiencies that have in common low levels of most immunoglobulin isotypes, the inability to form antibodies to antigen, an absence of gross defects in cell-mediated immunity, and the presence of recurrent bacterial infections.
 The history of immunoglobulin deficiency and its treatment is reviewed.
 Although the primary therapy for common variable immunodeficiency is gamma-globulin replacement, ancillary measures such as early treatment of infections with antibiotics are also important.
 Intravenous gamma-globulin replacement therapy is preferred to intramuscular replacement therapy in these patients because intramuscular doses must be limited in volume to minimize local pain and take 2 to 14 days to achieve maximal blood levels, during which time in situ degradation of up to 50% of the administered dose can occur.
 Five intravenous gamma-globulin preparations are currently available in the United States.
 The potential adverse effects of intravenous gamma-globulin infusion and the precautions currently taken to ensure safety during administration of this product are discussed.
