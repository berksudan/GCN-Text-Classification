Ibuprofen suspension in the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group.
 Ninety-two children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis were randomly assigned to treatment in a multicenter, double-blind, 12-week trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of a liquid formulation of ibuprofen at a dosage of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day versus those of aspirin at a dosage of 60 to 80 mg/kg/day.
 No significant intergroup differences in response rates or in the amount of improvement in articular indexes of disease activity were observed.
 More children treated with aspirin discontinued treatment early because of adverse reactions.
 After this trial, 84 additional patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis entered a 24-week, multidose (30, 40, and 50 mg/kg/day), open trial of ibuprofen suspension.
 Favorable response rates for the three groups were similar, and continued improvement was observed throughout the 24-week period.
 A dose-response relationship was observed with respect to adverse reactions of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
 We conclude that ibuprofen suspension is an effective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug and that its tolerability in children is acceptable.
