Clustering of fungal allergen-specific IgE antibody responses in allergic subjects.
 Statistical analysis of specific IgE immune responses to a panel of nine allergens from 2,094 patients demonstrated significant clustering between Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria alternata, and Cladosporium herbarum, not explained by crossreactive elements.
 This may represent a linked, high responder status to these fungal antigens in the allergic population.
