Treatment and career attitudes of prehospital care providers associated with potential exposure to HIV/AIDS.
 Career and treatment attitudes related to potential human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) exposure are reported based on a survey of 1,228 Maryland career and volunteer prehospital care providers trained to provide basic (BLS) and advanced (ALS) life support.
 Sixty-five percent stated potential exposure to HIV/AIDS was a major occupational stressor.
 Ninety-two percent stated they would treat HIV/AIDS patients if protected.
 Given a choice, 38% would avoid providing treatment to HIV/AIDS patients.
 Eighteen percent considered resigning from emergency medical services (EMS) work.
 An attitudinal scale (AIDSTRESS) was developed to evaluate overall treatment and career reactions.
 Respondents with significantly higher (more negative reactions) AIDSTRESS scores were: BLS providers, men, paid providers, personnel with more than 3 years of field experience, those working in urban areas, personnel with no formal education beyond high school, and those who stated that their HIV/AIDS training was inadequate.
 Implications of the findings for quality of care, career decision making, and inservice education are discussed.
