AIDS in the minds of Swedish people: 1986-1989.
 In order to assess changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviour related to AIDS, annual mail surveys (1986-1989) were sent to random samples of the general public, aged 16-44 years.
 In total, 16,900 individuals were sampled, with an average response rate of 71%.
 Knowledge about the major routes of infection was generally good during the entire study period.
 The fear of unverified infection risks and of contact with HIV-infected people decreased during the period studied, but still remained high in 1989.
 Over the entire period, respondents expressed a strong fear concerning the spread of HIV in the population.
 Although an increasing percentage of respondents reported altered sexual habits as a result of fear of AIDS, overall sexual behaviour did not change sufficiently to reduce the risk of spread of any sexually transmissible disease.
 Progress toward knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour aimed at prevention of transmission of infection and unnecessary fear and counteraction of prejudice was most rapid during the middle of the study period when public debate concerning AIDS was at its peak.
 Knowledge and attitudes did not change during the last year of the study, but, in some respects, reverted to previous levels.
