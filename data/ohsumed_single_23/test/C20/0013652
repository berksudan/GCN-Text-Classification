AIDS in the transfusion recipient.
 In summary, the HIV virus was transmitted to approximately 90% of recipients by infectious blood and blood products transfused prior to donor and product testing begun in March 1985.
 Self-elimination of at-risk donors several years prior to testing donor blood helped to reduce the number of infected donations.
 Virtually all contaminated donors are now eliminated.
 The multiply transfused patient developed a stimulated dysregulated immune system due to the numerous antigens and the iron in red cells and plasma.
 This dysregulated immune system has resulted in a variable response to the added exposure of the HIV virus.
 The incubation period and progression to disease have been prolonged and variable.
 Although a small number of patients have progressed as rapidly as other at-risk groups, many continue to do well without therapeutic intervention.
 Natural history of the disease needs continual monitoring to determine the ultimate outcome of these transfusion recipients.
