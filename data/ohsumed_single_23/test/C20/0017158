Comparison of cockroach allergenic activity in whole body and fecal extracts.
 Previous studies have established cockroach allergens as important sensitizing agents in the induction/exacerbation of urban asthma.
 The present investigation compared saline extracts of American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) whole bodies and feces and German cockroach (Blattella germanica) whole bodies and feces as important sources of allergens.
 All extracts were tested before or after gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 columns (fraction 2) as previously described.
 Skin test studies of 69 subjects with asthma with extracts of American or German cockroaches demonstrated a significant correlation of reactivity to whole body and fecal extracts for both species.
 Direct RASTs of 13 sera from cockroach skin test-positive subjects were generally greater to both German whole body extracts (GWBEs) and German fecal extracts (GFEs) as compared to American whole body and fecal extracts.
 There was a good correlation of RAST reactivity to GWBE with GFE.
 RAST inhibition demonstrated that GFE contained most of the allergenic activity present in GWBE.
 These studies demonstrate the allergenic similarities of cockroach whole body and fecal extracts and suggest that cockroach feces are an important sensitizing agent in atopic asthma.
