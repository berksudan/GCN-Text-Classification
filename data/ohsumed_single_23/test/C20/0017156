Airway effects of inhaled bradykinin, substance P, and neurokinin A in sheep.
 The effects of inhaled bradykinin (BK), substance P (SP), and neurokinin A (NKA) on pulmonary resistance and airway responsiveness to carbachol were studied in conscious allergic sheep.
 Inhaled BK (20 breaths, 0.1 to 5.0 mg.ml-1) caused dose-dependent increases in pulmonary resistance.
 Neither inhaled SP nor NKA (20 breaths, 0.1 to 1.0 mg.ml-1) produced significant bronchoconstriction in allergic sheep.
 However, the response to SP could be enhanced (p less than 0.05) by pretreatment with the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, thiorphan (40 breaths, 1 mg.ml-1).
 Sheep that were allergic to Ascaris suum antigen were 5.9 times (p less than 0.05) more sensitive to the constrictor effects of BK than nonallergic sheep.
 BK-induced bronchoconstriction was blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the BK beta 2-receptor antagonist, NPC 567 (D-arginine[hydroxyproline3,D-phenylalanine7]BK).
 Atropine (0.2 mg.kg-1, intravenously) and nedocromil sodium (1 mg.kg-1 in 3 ml of saline, aerosolized) significantly inhibited the BK-induced bronchoconstriction by 97% and 43%, respectively.
 Chlorpheniramine (2 mg.kg-1, intravenously) had no effect.
 NKA caused a transient increase in airway responsiveness in allergic sheep, producing a mean 1.9-fold leftward shift in dose-response curves to aerosolized carbachol (p less than 0.05).
 This hyperresponsiveness was not evident 24 hours after NKA challenge.
 Neither SP nor BK changed airway responsiveness.
 Thus, in allergic sheep, inhaled BK caused a more pronounced bronchoconstriction than that observed in nonallergic sheep.
 The bronchoconstriction was blocked by a BK-receptor antagonist and appeared to be partially mediated via cholinergic reflexes.
