T-cell-directed hepatocyte damage in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis.
 To investigate the function of activated T lymphocytes in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, 7 of 15 T-cell clones from the peripheral blood of 8 patients were studied.
 These clones showed specificity for liver-membrane antigen with proliferation when stimulated by rabbit liver cell membranes.
 6 of these clones reacted with liver-specific lipoprotein complex, and 1 clone (and 3 subclones) responded to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), both known targets of immune attack in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis.
 2 of these clones stimulated autologous B lymphocytes to produce liver-membrane-specific autoantibodies and antibody to the ASGPR.
 These results suggest that liver-membrane-specific activated T lymphocytes in peripheral blood may be important in the autoimmune attack of chronic active hepatitis.
