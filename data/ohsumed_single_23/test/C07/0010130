The surgical treatment of noma.
 Noma is a gangrenous stomatitis affecting children from developing countries.
 It may leave dreadful mutilations around the mouth, with amputation of the lips, cheek, nose, lids, maxilla, palate, or mandibula.
 Reconstruction should take into account the size of the defect, the presence of trismus or constriction of the mandible, the age of the child, and the child's general condition.
 During the last 3 years, eight patients were treated at the Unit of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of the Hopital Cantonal Universitaire.
 Except in one case, tracheostomy was avoided, thanks to intranasal intubation by fibroscopy.
 These children, aged 2 to 9 years, underwent 31 general anesthesias and complex reconstructive procedures, including latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous pedunculated and free flaps, cranial flaps with galea, cranial bone and skin grafts, and retroauricular temporal skin flaps.
 All patients were able to return to Africa with dramatic functional and cosmetic improvements.
 However, satisfactory mouth opening and mandibular function were not always obtained.
