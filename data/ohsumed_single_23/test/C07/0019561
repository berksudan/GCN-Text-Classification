Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of peritonsillar abscess.
 Thirty-four aspirates of pus from peritonsillar abscesses that were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria showed bacterial growth.
 A total 107 bacterial isolates (58 anaerobic and 49 aerobic and facultative) were recovered, accounting for 3.1 isolates per specimen (1.7 anaerobic and 1.4 aerobic and facultatives).
 Anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (18%) patients, aerobic and facultatives in 2 (6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 26 (76%).
 Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 4 infections, 2 of which were Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 were anaerobic bacteria.
 The predominant bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), Bacteroides sp (21 isolates, including 15 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group), and Peptostreptococcus sp (16) and S.
 pyogenes (10).
 beta-Lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 13 (52%) of 25 specimens tested.
 This retrospective study highlights the polymicrobial nature and importance of anaerobic bacteria in peritonsillar abscess.
