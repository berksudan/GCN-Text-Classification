Sensitivity restored of Class V abrasion/erosion lesions.
 The effectiveness of restorative treatment in reducing sensitivity associated with the Class V erosion/abrasion lesion was evaluated and the efficacy of three tooth-colored restorative materials in reducing sensitivity was compared.
 The 108 lesions were restored with either glass ionomer restorative material, composite resin with a dentin bonding agent, or composite resin with a dentin bonding agent and a glass ionomer liner.
 Composite resin with glass-ionomer liner restorations significantly reduced sensitivity to air and hot and cold water.
 Glass ionomer restorations and restorations with composite resin and a dentin bonding agent significantly reduced sensitivity but were also associated with increased sensitivity to air and cold respectively in 20% to 30% of the lesions restored when evaluated at 6 months.
