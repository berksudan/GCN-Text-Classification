A retrospective clinical study of endodontically treated mandibular incisors in a selected Chinese population.
 Clinical studies of incidences of the number of canals in human teeth should correlate with the percentages obtained in laboratory samples.
 In this study the incidence of two canals in the mandibular incisors was compared with figures obtained from in vitro extracted teeth, as well as from one clinical study.
 A very low percentage was obtained from the examination of clinical records, and this could be due to racial differences in the samples examined.
