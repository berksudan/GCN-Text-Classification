Randomized, double-blind trial of mazindol in Duchenne dystrophy.
 There is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy.
 We conducted a 12-month controlled trial of mazindol, a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor, in 83 boys with Duchenne dystrophy.
 Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol (3 mg/d) or placebo.
 The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0.90 to detect a slowing to 25% of the expected rate of progression of weakness at P less than 0.05.
 Mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study.
 Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite (36%), dry mouth (10%), behavioral change (22%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (18%); mazindol dosage was reduced in 43% of patients.
 The effect of mazindol on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF-I levels obtained following 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in the mazindol treated to those in the placebo groups.
 Although mazindol-treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo-treated patients, no significant effect on IGF-I levels was observed.
 Mazindol doses not slow the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy.
