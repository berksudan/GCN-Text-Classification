A comparative study of temporomandibular symptoms following mandibular advancement by bilateral sagittal split osteotomies: rigid versus nonrigid fixation.
 Rigid fixation to attach proximal and distal segments during bony healing of osteotomy sites has become increasingly popular.
 The effects of rigid fixation on the temporomandibular joints have been questioned.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of rigid fixation after bilateral sagittal split osteotomies on temporomandibular dysfunction symptoms.
 Forty patients who had mandibular advancement surgery were evaluated for temporomandibular joint dysfunction.
 Twenty had received rigid fixation, and twenty had received nonrigid fixation.
 It was determined that there was no statistically significant difference in temporomandibular signs or symptoms between patients who were treated with rigid internal fixation for bilateral sagittal split osteotomies for mandibular advancement and those patients who were treated with nonrigid wire fixation.
