Indications for simultaneous orthognathic and septorhinoplastic surgery.
 Orthognathic and rhinoplastic surgery can be combined successfully when certain guidelines are understood.
 Relative indications and contraindications have been established that generally yield predictable results.
 Tip position (rotation and projection) may be the most difficult aspect to predict and, therefore, is best avoided during simultaneous surgery.
 Major deformities of the dorsum can be easily corrected in conjunction with maxillary surgery.
 Three cases demonstrating these guidelines are presented and discussed.
