Maintenance of condyle-proximal segment position in orthognathic surgery.
 Twenty patients underwent bilateral sagittal ramus osteotomy for the correction of mandibular retrognathia.
 A condylar positioning device (CPD) was used intraoperatively in 10 patients to maintain preoperative condyle-proximal segment position, while the CPD was not used in the other 10 patients.
 Postoperatively, the condyle-proximal segment positions in both groups were compared and evaluated for vertical, horizontal, and rotational changes.
 A significant improvement (P less than .05) was observed in the vertical and horizontal condylar position in the group in which the CPD was used.
 However, there was no significant difference in proximal segment rotation.
