Pancreatic autoantibodies and pancreatic function in Sjogren's syndrome.
 Pancreatic autoantibodies were determined in 49 patients with Sjogren's syndrome and related to functional parameters.
 Pancreatic duct autoantibodies (PDA) were detected in the sera of three patients, and all showed abnormal exocrine pancreatic function.
 Islet cell antibodies (ICA) were not detected in the sera of the 49 patients, including two individuals with diabetes mellitus.
 In conclusion, PDA occur in patients with Sjogren's syndrome, and may be associated with exocrine pancreatic dysfunction.
