Terconazole for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.
 A double-blind, randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of terconazole for vulvovaginal candidiasis.
 Treatment consisted of daily intravaginal application of one of the following regimens: 80-mg terconazole suppositories for 3 days, miconazole nitrate suppositories for 7 days or placebo suppositories for 7 days.
 The terconazole and miconazole nitrate groups had significantly higher therapeutic cure rates than did the placebo group.
 Evaluation of vaginal secretions with microscopic examination showed no evidence of leukocyte proliferation.
 Proline aminopeptidase activity, present in patients who have bacterial vaginosis, could not be detected in the vaginal secretions from patients with yeast vulvovaginitis.
