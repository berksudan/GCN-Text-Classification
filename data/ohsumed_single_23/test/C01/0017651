Endogenous colonization by gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli elaborating aminoglycoside (3)-5-acetyltransferase.
 Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae that elaborate aminoglycoside 3-5-acetyltransferase [AAC(3)-5] caused a nosocomial outbreak at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and have persisted.
 To see whether the gene for AAC(3)-5 was present in the community, stool cultures of newly admitted patients and ambulatory persons were examined with a specific gene probe.
 AAC(3)-5-positive strains were present in the intestinal flora examined.
