Cytokines and glucocorticoids in the regulation of the "hepato-skeletal muscle axis" in sepsis.
 Sepsis results in muscle catabolism and peripheral release of amino acids with a concomitant uptake of amino acids in liver and acute-phase protein synthesis.
 In addition, there appears to be a cytokine-induced process that blocks muscle amino acid uptake in sepsis, further diverting amino acids from the periphery to the liver.
 In this article, evidence that cytokines and glucocorticoids play an important role in the regulation of hepatic and muscle protein metabolism during sepsis is presented.
