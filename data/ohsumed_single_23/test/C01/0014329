Indium-111-labeled leukocyte scan in detection of synthetic vascular graft infection: the effect of antibiotic treatment.
 To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the indium-111-(111In) labeled leukocyte scan for prosthetic vascular graft infection in patients treated with antibiotic therapy, a retrospective study was performed.
 Of 41 consecutive 111In-labeled leukocyte scans performed to evaluate possible vascular graft infection, 23 scans were performed in patients treated with antibiotics.
 The average duration of antibiotic therapy was 21 days.
 Twelve positive and 11 negative scans for graft infection were found.
 By surgical and autopsy correlation of all positive cases, and clinical correlation (of all negative cases), there were 10 true-positive, 11 true-negative, 2 false-positive, and no false-negative scans for graft infections, for an overall sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85%.
