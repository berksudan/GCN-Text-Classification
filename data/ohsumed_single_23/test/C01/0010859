Fluconazole: a new triazole antifungal agent.
 Fluconazole is a fluorine-substituted, bis-triazole antifungal agent.
 Its mechanism of action, like that of other azoles, involves interruption of the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol via binding to fungal cytochrome P-450 and subsequent disruption of fungal membranes.
 Activity against Aspergillus spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Candida spp., Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis has been demonstrated in several animal models.
 Fluconazole can be administered both orally and intravenously.
 Mean peak serum concentrations achieved in human volunteers after 50 and 100 mg (oral) are 3.1 and 7.0 mumols/L respectively.
 Protein binding is low (11 percent) and cerebrospinal fluid to serum ratio is 0.58 to 0.89.
 Serum half-life is long (22-32 hours) and elimination is via renal clearance of unchanged drug.
 Clinical trials and reports support the use of fluconazole in treatment of candidiasis, particularly oropharyngeal and esophageal infections in immunocompromised hosts.
 Fluconazole is also approved for initial and suppressive therapy of cryptococcal meningitis.
 Its role in management of systemic fungal infections will be further defined once results of other comparative trials become available.
 Fluconazole is well tolerated and its effects on steroidogenesis are markedly less than those of ketoconazole.
 Antipyrine clearance is not altered at low doses (50 mg) of fluconazole; however, drug interactions with the use of larger doses can be anticipated with agents such as cyclosporin, phenytoin, oral hypoglycemics, and warfarin.
 Rifampin appears to decrease metabolic clearance of fluconazole.
 Fluconazole is available as oral and parenteral formulations.
 Once-daily doses of 100-400 mg are recommended.
 Dosage reduction is advised for patients with impaired renal function.
