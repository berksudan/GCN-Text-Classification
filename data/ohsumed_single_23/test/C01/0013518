Tumor necrosis factor-independent IL-6 production during murine listeriosis.
 We report that TNF, IL-6, and IFN-alpha/beta are produced by mice during either sublethal or lethal Listeria monocytogenes infections.
 The quantities of these cytokines in infected spleens increase and decrease in concordance with bacterial numbers in these organs.
 While all of these cytokines were present in Listeria-infected spleens, only IL-6 and IFN-alpha/beta were found in the peripheral circulation.
 Inasmuch as TNF has been reported to be responsible for the production of IL-6 in vivo following the inoculation of a lethal dose of the Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli (Fong et al., 1989.

 170: 1627), experiments were undertaken to determine whether IL-6 production elicited by the Gram-positive bacterium, L.
 monocytogenes, was also TNF-dependent.
 It was found that the passive immunization of mice with neutralizing antibodies specific for TNF shortly before i.v.
 injection of a lethal or sublethal Listeria inoculum resulted in the complete neutralization of endogenously produced TNF, and in the progressive multiplication of bacteria in infected organs.
 It was also found that the anti-TNF IgG treatment resulted in a progressive increase in the amounts of Listeria-induced IL-6 present in spleen and blood, until the death of the host.
 These findings indicate that Listeria-induced IL-6 production in mice occurs primarily through a TNF-independent pathway, and correlates directly with the severity of the infection.
