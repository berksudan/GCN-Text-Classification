Antibiotics for common infections in the elderly.
 A decline in host defense mechanisms and concurrent diseases combine to make the elderly patient particularly susceptible to common infections.
 The bacterial cause and antimicrobial sensitivity patterns may also be different in the elderly.
 The appropriate selection and dosing of antibiotics for elderly patients with such common infections as pneumonia, bronchitis, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft-tissue infections will optimize the patient's response while minimizing adverse consequences.
