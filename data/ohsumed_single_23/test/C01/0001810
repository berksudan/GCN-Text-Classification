Safety and immunogenicity of Haemophilus influenzae type b oligosaccharide-CRM197 conjugate vaccine in infants aged 15 to 23 months.
 A total of 268 infants aged 15 to 23 months received one dose of a vaccine composed of Haemophilus influenzae type b oligosaccharides covalently linked to the nontoxic diphtheria toxin variant CRM197 (HbOC; HibTITER).
 Side effects associated with vaccination were infrequent, transient, and mild.
 One month after a single vaccination, the anti-H influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide antibody concentration rose from a geometric mean prevaccination level of 0.20 microgram/mL to 13.77 micrograms/mL.
 Of these infants, 99% had a postvaccination level greater than or equal to 1.00 microgram/mL, a level associated with long-term protection.
 The immune response was long-lived: all of the children who were monitored 17 to 27 months after vaccination had concentrations greater than or equal to 1.00 microgram/mL.
 The anti-H influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide antibody generated was predominantly of the IgG isotype and IgG1 subclass.
 The immune sera had bactericidal activity in vitro and conferred passive protection in the infant rat meningitis model.
