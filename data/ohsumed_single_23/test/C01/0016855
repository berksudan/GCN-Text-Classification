Effect of dietary fish oil on plasma thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha levels in septic rats.
 Increased mortality from sepsis is associated with high levels of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha).
 Linoleic acid, an n-6 essential fatty acid, is the usual precursor of TXB2 and PGF1 alpha, while fish oil is rich in n-3 essential fatty acid, the precursor of less active moieties.
 Rats were fed chow, an essential fatty acid-deficient diet, or an essential fatty acid-deficient diet supplemented with linoleic acid or fish oil for 2 weeks.
 The animals then underwent a sham operation or cecal ligation and puncture to induce sepsis.
 Six hours later, blood was obtained for analysis.
 The chow and linoleic acid diets produced significant (twofold to fivefold) increases in levels of both TXB2 and PGF1 alpha after sepsis.
 The essential fatty acid-deficient diet and fish oil diet protected against increases in levels of TXB2 or PGF1 alpha during sepsis.
 Dietary restriction of linoleic acid or fish oil supplementation may play an important role in altering the inflammatory mediator response to sepsis.
