Clinical and immunologic responses to Haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine in infants injected at 3, 5, 7, and 18 months of age.
 The safety and immunogenicity of Haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Hib-TT) were evaluated in 77 healthy infants receiving injections at 3, 5, 7, and 18 months of age.
 No serious local or systemic reactions were noted.
 After the first injection the geometric mean Hib antibody level rose to 0.55 micrograms/ml, and each subsequent injection elicited a statistically significant rise in the geometric mean.
 The percentage of vaccinees with Hib antibody levels greater than 0.15 micrograms/ml serum was 75.5% after the first, 97.4% after the second, and 100% after the third Hib-TT injection.
 This percentage fell to 90.9% at 18 months of age but rose again to 100% after the fourth injection.
 Control infants (n = 10) injected with diphtheria-tetanus toxoid-pertussis vaccine only had nondetectable levels after the second injection.
 Hib-TT elicited increases of Hib antibody in all isotypes: IgG greater than IgM greater than IgA.
 Among IgG subclasses the highest increases were of IgG1.
 All vaccinated subjects had greater than 0.01 U/ml of TT antibody (estimated protective level) throughout the study.
 We conclude that Hib-TT, injected at 3, 5, 7, and 18 months, is safe and induces protective levels of antibodies during the age of highest incidence of meningitis caused by Hib.
