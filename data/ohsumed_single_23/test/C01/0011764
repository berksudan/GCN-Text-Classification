Syphilis. A new visit from an old enemy.
 Syphilis has a number of stages, including a latent one, and may be overlooked or misdiagnosed if the possibility is not kept in mind.
 Adequate treatment during the primary stage results in a very high cure rate.
 The latent stage may last for years, during which time a woman may still give birth to an infected child.
 Symptomatic neurosyphilis occurs more often in men than women.
 Penicillin G is preferred to treat all stages of the disease; other antibiotics can be used for patients sensitive to penicillin.
