Successful treatment of disseminated cutaneous cytomegalic inclusion disease associated with Hodgkin's disease.
 A case of disseminated cutaneous cytomegalic inclusion disease associated with Hodgkin's disease is described.
 The patient had a diffuse eruption of pruritic, erosive erythematous nodules.
 Histologically, many inclusion bodies were observed in perivascular areas of the skin lesions.
 Immunohistologically, the inclusion bodies positively stained with both anticytomegalovirus antibody and anti-factor VIII-related antibody.
 On electron microscopy many virus particles and dense bodies were found in the area where inclusion bodies were observed.
 Treatment with high-dose intravenous acyclovir and a large amount of immunoglobulin resulted in prompt healing of the skin lesions.
 Subsequently, the patient's Hodgkin's disease was well controlled on chemotherapy.
 The patient steadily improved without relapse of skin lesions 1 year after antiviral therapy was administered.
