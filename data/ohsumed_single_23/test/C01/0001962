A study to assess the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis in the prevention of endoscopy-related bacteraemia in patients aged 60 and over.
 Five hundred and fifteen patients aged 60 and over (mean age 74.7; 278 men and 237 women) underwent routine endoscopic procedures (gastroscopy, bronchoscopy and cystoscopy).
 Alternate patients were given antibiotics before the procedure, as currently recommended, and blood was taken for culture from all patients within five minutes of completion of the procedure.
 Of 74 patients who underwent bronchoscopy, only one culture, from one of 37 controls was positive.
 Of 262 who underwent gastroscopy, cultures were negative in the 130 who received antibiotics but positive in 13 of the 132 controls (9.8 per cent p less than 0.001).
 Cystoscopy was performed in 179; one culture was positive in the 88 given antibiotics (1.1 per cent) compared to 25 in the 91 controls (27.5 per cent; p less than 0.001).
 Bacteraemia rates appear to be low following bronchoscopy (less than 5 per cent) but higher with gastroscopy (10 per cent) and cystoscopy (28 per cent).
 Chemoprophylaxis was effective in reducing these rates in this patient group.
