Absence of bacteremia during nasal septoplasty.
 Episodes of staphylococcal bacteremia resulting in metastatic infection have occurred in association with nasal septoplasty, and this has suggested the possible need for antimicrobial prophylaxis.
 In a study designed to measure the actual frequency with which transient staphylococcal bacteremia occurs during nasal septoplasty, 50 healthy patients had blood cultures drawn immediately prior to and during the procedure.
 Although 46% of the 50 patients studied had their nasal mucosa colonized with Staphylococcus aureus, some of the blood cultures obtained from the 50 patients showed bacterial growth.
 The authors conclude that staphylococcal bacteremia during nasal septoplasty is a rare occurrence, and that antimicrobial prophylaxis is unnecessary.
