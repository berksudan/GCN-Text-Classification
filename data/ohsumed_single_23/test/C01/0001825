Poor compliance with universal precautions: a universal phenomenon?
 An anonymous survey was conducted in order to examine compliance with universal precautions in the Department of Pediatrics at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Illinois.
 Completed questionnaires were returned by 23 faculty members, 29 residents, and 22 medical students.
 Gloves were worn consistently during venipuncture or intravenous catheterization by 13, 7, and 18% of attending physicians, residents, and students, respectively.
 Most physicians wear gloves only occasionally and cite presence of high-risk factors as their selection criterion.
 Interference with the performance of procedures is the most common cause of noncompliance.
 In view of poor compliance with universal precautions, further efforts are needed in order to decrease the incidence of preventable exposure to blood-borne infections.
