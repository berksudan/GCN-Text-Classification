Efficacy of short courses of oral novobiocin-rifampin in eradicating carrier state of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and in vitro killing studies of clinical isolates.
 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important nosocomial infection problem.
 Colonization appears to be more common than invasive disease is.
 Eradication of colonization or the carrier state could limit the spread of MRSA, thus reducing the potential for mortality and morbidity in other patients.
 The detection of patients with MRSA infection in a rehabilitation ward led to a study of the combination of novobiocin-rifampin in vivo and in vitro.
 We found that 300 mg of rifampin plus 500 mg of novobiocin orally twice daily for 5 days, in 18 courses of treatment given to 12 patients, resulted in the clearing of MRSA in 79% of the evaluable courses and 81% of the evaluable sites.
 A second course cleared MRSA from one of the patients with a treatment failure.
 Side effects were not noted.
 All 18 pretherapy isolates were susceptible to either drug in vitro, but 1 of 2 posttherapy isolates was rifampin resistant.
 Timed-kill studies demonstrated that the rate of killing was the same with either drug alone or both drugs together.
 Pretherapy isolates from treatment successes or failure were killed at the same rate by the drug combination.
 However, with the rifampin-resistant isolate killing ceased after 48 h.
 Results of this study suggest that previously untreated patients are likely to have isolates that are susceptible to the combination of drugs and that the combination is commonly effective in eradicating MRSA carriage.
 Since the regimen is orally administered, and thus convenient, in conjunction with other measures it has the promise of reducing the spread of MRSA in hospitals.
