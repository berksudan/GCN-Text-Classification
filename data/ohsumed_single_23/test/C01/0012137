Metabolic changes in patients severely affected by tetanus.
 Metabolic changes in six severely affected tetanus patients suffering from characteristic labile hypertension (maximum systolic blood pressure greater than 200 mmHG, maximum diurnal change in systolic pressure greater than 100 mmHg) were investigated.
 Daily urinary excretion of urea nitrogen increased gradually from the onset of opisthotonus, reached a peak value (10.4 to 15.4 g/m2) in 8 to 20 days, and decreased subsequently.
 Average cumulative excretion in 30 days reached 239.6 +/- 32.7 g/m2.
 Urine catecholamine excretion was elevated in each patient and remained elevated during this period.
 Plasma cortisol and glucagon concentrations were not increased markedly except in a case complicated other systemic bacterial infection.
 Increased protein catabolism in these patients could not be explained by the metabolic effects of 'stressed hormones' alone, and neurologic factors must be considered.
