Adipose tissue fatty acid composition and its relations to diet and plasma lipid concentrations in hemodialysis patients.
 Adipose tissue fatty acid composition, serum lipid profile, and dietary intake of 37 patients on maintenance hemodialysis were studied.
 In August 1982, 1984, and 1986, analyses were carried out in 15 normotriglyceridemic (NTG) and 22 hypertriglyceridemic (HTG; type IV hyperlipidemia) patients.
 No correlations were found between dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (P-S ratio), and carbohydrate content on the one hand and serum lipid concentrations on the other in the two groups.
 Adipose tissue linolenic acid correlated negatively with serum cholesterol in both groups.
 Strong correlations were found between dietary intake of PUFAs and adipose tissue linoleic acid content, between PUFAs and the double-bond index, between P-S ratio and adipose tissue linoleic acid content, and between P-S ratio and the double-bond index.
 No significant differences in dietary intake or adipose tissue fatty acid composition were observed between NTG and HTG patients.
 Thus, no evidence was found for exogenous dietary influences on serum lipid concentrations.
 The adipose tissue linoleic acid content did reflect the dietary intake of PUFAs.
