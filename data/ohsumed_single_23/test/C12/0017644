Comparative study of cephradine and amoxicillin-clavulanate in the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections.
 Eighty-eight female patients with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections were treated according to a randomization scheme with either 1 g of cephradine every 12 h (47 patients) or 375 mg of amoxicillin-clavulanate every 8 h (41 patients) for 7 days.
 The treatments were equally effective (cure rates of 89% for cephradine and 88% for amoxicillin-clavulanate) and showed similar relapse rates (cephradine, 14%; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 11%).
 Adverse effects were similar in both groups (cephradine, 23%; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 22%).
