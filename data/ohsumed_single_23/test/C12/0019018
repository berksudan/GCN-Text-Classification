Distal urethral electrical conductance (DUEC)--a preliminary assessment of its role as a quick screening test for incontinent women.
 Measurement of distal urethral electrical conductance (DUEC) has been used to detect the movement of urine along the distal urethra.
 DUEC was used as a screening test in 100 women attending the urodynamic clinic with incontinence and in the 33 women who voided over 250 ml, the findings correlated well with subsequent urodynamic diagnosis of urethral sphincter incompetence and detrusor instability.
