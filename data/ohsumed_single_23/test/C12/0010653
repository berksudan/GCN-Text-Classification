Molecular biology of the renal renin-angiotensin system.
 This paper describes an interrelated series of studies designed to examine molecular and cellular aspects of renin expression and release within the kidney.
 Using immunocytochemical techniques, Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, measurement of renin activity, and the reverse hemolytic plaque assay, it has been possible to demonstrate that the intrarenal distribution of renin, renin gene expressing cells and the number of renin secretory cells vary during diverse physiologic and pathologic conditions.
 Overall, these studies demonstrate that the renal preglomerular vasculature has the plasticity and capacity to elicit a recruitment of renin containing and/or renin gene expressing cells.
