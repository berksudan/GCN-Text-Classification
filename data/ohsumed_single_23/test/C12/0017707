Self-administered intraurethral chlorpromazine: an unusual cause of priapism.
 Priapism is a prolonged, painful penile erection unaccompanied by sexual desire and not alleviated by ejaculation.
 The etiologies of priapism are numerous and diverse.
 Priapism can be a serious adverse effect of psychotropic medications.
 The case of a 36-year-old man who demonstrated priapism, 48 hours after inserting a crushed chlorpromazine tablet into the urethral meatus of his penis, is reported.
 Priapism induced by this route of drug administration has not been previously described.
 The pathophysiology and treatment of priapism are reviewed.
