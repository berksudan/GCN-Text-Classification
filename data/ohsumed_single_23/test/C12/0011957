An evaluation of the efficacy and safety of doxazosin in hypertension associated with renal dysfunction. The Japanese Doxazosin Study Group.
 Doxazosin was administered once daily to 26 patients with renal hypertension or hypertension associated with renal dysfunction.
 Doxazosin produced a significant reduction in blood pressure that was stable throughout the treatment period.
 A significant change was not observed in heart rate.
 Blood pressure was "markedly decreased" or "decreased" in 80% of patients receiving doxazosin monotherapy, 78.6% of patients receiving combined therapy, and 79.2% of all the patients.
 The cumulative efficacy ratio according to final daily dose was 62.5% with 1 to 4 mg/day and 75.0% to 79.2% with 8 to 16 mg/day.
 Side effects were observed in three patients (12.0%), none of them severe, and all side effects disappeared with continued administration of doxazosin.
 Abnormal laboratory values in six items were observed in four patients.
 Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen values, which were regarded as renal function parameters, did not show significant changes, and no negative influence was observed with respect to doxazosin therapy.
 Overall clinical usefulness was considered "very useful" or "useful" in 80% of patients receiving doxazosin monotherapy, 78.6% of patients receiving combination therapy, and 79.2% of all patients.
 In conclusion, once-daily administration of doxazosin was considered a useful antihypertensive therapy for renal hypertension and hypertension associated with renal dysfunction.
