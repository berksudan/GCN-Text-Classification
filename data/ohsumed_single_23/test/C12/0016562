Use of standard contraceptive diaphragm in management of stress urinary incontinence.
 The management of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) consists of either surgical intervention and/or pharmacologic manipulation.
 Twelve patients with SUI were evaluated for management by the use of a fitted standard contraceptive diaphragm.
 Complete resolution of SUI was achieved in 11 of 12 patients (91%).
 Two of the 12 patients achieved continence but withdrew from the study because of associated discomfort from the diaphragm, therefore, complete resolution of SUI was achieved in 9 of 12 patients (75%).
