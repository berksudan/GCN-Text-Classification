The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and dietary protein restriction in the treatment of proteinuria.
 Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and dietary protein restriction have been reported to reduce urinary protein losses in patients with chronic glomerular diseases.
 We evaluated these two therapies in 12 such patients ingesting a constant metabolic diet containing 1.6 g protein/kg body weight per day.
 After a steady-state was achieved during a 3-week baseline period, patients were randomly assigned to either enalapril, titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by 10 mm Hg, or an isocaloric 0.8 g/kg protein diet.
 Five patients in each group completed 3 additional weeks of observation during the treatment period.
 Enalapril resulted in an average reduction in urinary protein and albumin losses of 26% and 33%, respectively, without reducing creatinine clearance.
 Albumin synthesis was unchanged and nitrogen balance increased slightly (+142.8 +/- 85.7 mmol/d [+2.0 +/- 1.2 g/d], P = 0.075).
 Dietary protein restriction had no consistent effect on proteinuria or albuminuria, whereas albumin synthesis (25.9 +/- 3.4 v 21.5 +/- 2.9 g/d/1.73 m2, P less than 0.05) and nitrogen balance (-135.6 +/- 92.8 mmol/d [-1.9 +/- 1.3 g/d], P = 0.10) decreased.
 Both therapies resulted in a modest increase in plasma potassium concentration.
 Whether the maintenance of albumin synthesis in the presence of a reduction in urinary protein losses will convey a long-term advantage to treatment of proteinuric patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remains to be determined.
