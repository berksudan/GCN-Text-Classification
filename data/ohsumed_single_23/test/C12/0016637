Calcitriol metabolism in patients with chronic renal failure.
 We studied calcitriol metabolism in white patients with chronic renal failure and in age- and sex-matched normal subjects.
 The plasma levels of calcitriol (21.9 +/- 1.6 pg/mL, n = 7, v control, 37.4 +/- 2.9 pg/mL, P less than 0.001), metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of calcitriol (0.45 +/- .01 mL/min/kg v control, 0.58 +/- .02 mL/min/kg, P less than 0.001), and production rate (PR) of calcitriol (14.2 +/- 1.0 ng/kg/d v control, 31.8 +/- 3.2 ng/kg/d, P less than 0.001) were significantly lower in patients with moderate renal failure (average creatinine clearance, 0.59 +/- 0.01 mL/s [35.1 +/- 6.1 mL/min]) when compared with the respective values of normal control subjects.
 The MCR of calcitriol was determined again in patients with renal failure after they received calcitriol, 1 microgram/d, for 1 week.
 The MCR remained unchanged (0.46 +/- .04 mL/min/kg, n = 7) and plasma levels of calcitriol were increased to 34.6 +/- 2.77 pg/mL.
 The mechanism by which the MCR of calcitriol decreases in renal failure is partly due to the presence of inhibitory factors of degradation enzymes in uremic plasma.
 When the ultrafiltrates of uremic plasma obtained from hemodialysis patients were infused to normal Sprague-Dawley rats, the MCRs of calcitriol (0.20 +/- .01 mL/min/kg, n = 6) were markedly suppressed in comparison to those of rats infused with the ultrafiltrates of normal plasma (0.37 +/- .01 mL/min/kg, n = 6, P less than 0.001).
 The uremic plasma also contained factors that inhibit the synthesis of calcitriol.
 We conclude that metabolic degradation of calcitriol is decreased in patients with renal failure, and uremic plasma contains inhibitory factors that suppress the synthesis and degradation of calcitriol.
