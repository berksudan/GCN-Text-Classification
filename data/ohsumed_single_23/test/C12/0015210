The bed-wetting child. Current management of a frustrating problem.
 Bed-wetting is a frustrating problem experienced by a significant number of children.
 It is the role of the physician to exclude serious underlying problems and, at the same time, educate the family concerning treatment options that may be best suited to their child.
 Once parents and child have a better understanding of the problem and realize that the outlook for nighttime bladder control is excellent, it is easier to start long-term care.
