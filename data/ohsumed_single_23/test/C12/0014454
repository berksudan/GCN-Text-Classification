Bioavailability of potassium and magnesium, and citraturic response from potassium-magnesium citrate.
 The bioavailability of potassium and magnesium, and the citraturic response were determined for the new compound, potassium-magnesium citrate, in 14 normal volunteers.
 Results were compared to those of potassium citrate and magnesium citrate.
 Each subject participated in 4 phases of study: potassium-magnesium citrate, potassium citrate, magnesium citrate and potassium chloride.
 After stabilization on a metabolic diet, each subject ingested a single load of a test medication followed by timed urine collections for the next 24 hours.
 Test loads included potassium-magnesium citrate (49 mEq.
 potassium, 24.5 mEq.
 magnesium and 73.5 mEq.
 citrate), potassium citrate (50 mEq.), potassium chloride (50 mEq.) and magnesium citrate (25 mEq.) Urinary potassium, magnesium and citrate were measured for each collection period.
 Potassium-magnesium citrate provided an equivalent potassium bioavailability as potassium citrate and potassium chloride, and a comparable magnesium bioavailability as magnesium citrate.
 However, it gave the highest citraturic response, since the cumulative increment in urinary citrate post-load was 129 mg.
 daily for potassium-magnesium citrate, 105 mg.
 daily for potassium citrate and 35 mg.
 daily for magnesium citrate.
 Thus, potassium-magnesium citrate gave an optimum citraturic response in addition to providing absorbable potassium and magnesium.
