Determination of prostate volume with transrectal US for cancer screening. Part I. Comparison with prostate-specific antigen assays.
 To investigate whether radiologists can objectively define a high-risk group for prostate cancer, the researchers measured gland volume and compared it with results of a screening blood test, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay.
 A total of 768 men, aged 55-71 years, were self-referred to two prostate cancer screening programs using transrectal ultrasound (US) and digital rectal examination.
 In patients with no evidence of cancer, statistically significant increases in mean PSA values were noted with increasing gland volume ranges (P less than .05).
 PSA values in patients with cancer were more likely to exceed the volume-adjusted 95th percentile (mean + [1.65.standard deviation]) than those in patients with negative biopsy results (P less than .005).
 Patients with PSA values above the volume-adjusted 95th percentile have an estimated risk for prostate cancer up to nine times that of the general screening population.
 The researchers conclude that knowledge of transrectal US gland volume and prostate-specific antigen assay type are important objective variables for future prostate cancer screening programs.
 The volume-adjusted 95th percentiles presented may help guide cost-effective management of current early detection efforts.
