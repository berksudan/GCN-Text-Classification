Simple standing incremental cystometry as a screening method for detrusor instability.
 One hundred consecutive neurologically normal women complaining of urinary incontinence underwent standing incremental retrograde medium-fill water cystometrograms on two different days followed by sitting and standing continuous retrograde medium-fill water urethrocystometry on a third visit between November 1987 and February 1989.
 Studies were done to assess the reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of a simple cystometer.
 Standing incremental, retrograde cystometry was found to be relatively inexpensive, simple, reproducible, and sensitive.
 The two cystometrograms yielded similar results in 84% of the patients.
 The sensitivities were found to be 84.3 and 90.2% for the first and second cystometrograms, respectively.
 Using both cystometrograms together, we were able to detect detrusor instability with a sensitivity of 92.3% and to predict its absence with a negative predictive value of 86.7%.
 Detrusor instability was found in 64% of these patients.
 Based on these results, it was concluded that when multichannel urodynamics are not available in a high-prevalence population, standing retrograde incremental water cystometry done on two occasions may offer the physician an accurate alternative for the diagnosis of detrusor instability.
