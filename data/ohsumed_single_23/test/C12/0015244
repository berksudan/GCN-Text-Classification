Human papillomavirus in prostatic cancer: no evidence found by in situ DNA hybridization.
 Human papillomavirus has been associated with benign squamous tumors, intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive squamous cancer.
 The role of human papillomavirus as the most likely precursor of cervical dysplasia is well studied.
 We know of no available information as to the possible role of human papillomavirus in prostatic hyperplasia and cancer.
 We studied formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 20 cases of glandular hyperplasia and 20 cases of prostatic cancer by in situ DNA hybridization for human papillomavirus using commercially available biotinylated DNA probes detected by an avidin-biotin peroxidase technique.
 We found no evidence of DNA hybridization to human papillomavirus-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, -33, or -35 in prostate tissue.
 Our results show no association between prostatic cancer or hyperplasia and the human papillomavirus genomes that were studied.
