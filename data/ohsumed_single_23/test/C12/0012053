Desmopressin-induced improvement in bleeding times in chronic renal failure patients correlates with platelet serotonin uptake and ATP release.
 Hemostatic defects resulting in life-threatening hemorrhagic episodes are a common occurrence in the chronic renal failure patient.
 Hemorrhagic tendencies correlate best with laboratory tests of bleeding times.
 The identification of a specific hemostatic defect and its role in bleeding dyscrasias has yet to be elucidated.
 Our studies demonstrate that factor VIII coagulant activity and factor VIII related antigen (vWF:Ag) are normal or greatly elevated in uremic renal failure patients with greatly prolonged bleeding times.
 The multimeric state of the von Willebrand factor is also normal in these patients.
 The bleeding times were normalized in all 15 patients, 90 minutes post-infusion with desmopressin (DDAVP).
 No significant changes in factor VIII/vWF associated properties, blood cell counts, or coagulation factors were observed post-DDAVP treatment.
 However, a significant increase in platelet serotonin uptake (p less than .025) and ATP release (p less than .025) was detected after DDAVP treatment.
 These results indicate that DDAVP acts on the platelet membrane.
 This is further substantiated by the ability of DDAVP to block vasopressin-induced platelet aggregation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion.
 Perturbations in the movement and storage of serotonin and the release of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) in the platelets of uremic individuals are proposed to play a critical role in regulating bleeding times.
