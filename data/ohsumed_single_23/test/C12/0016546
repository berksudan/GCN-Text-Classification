Use of suramin in treatment of prostatic carcinoma refractory to conventional hormonal manipulation.
 Suramin and related compounds, in view of their growth factor and enzyme binding properties, represent in many respects a novel approach to the treatment of cancer.
 Although in this preliminary analysis of suramin use in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, the objective response rate does not appear impressive, much work still needs to be done to optimize suramin's administration to patients and to elucidate its various postulated mechanisms of action.
 The development of related compounds with more specific enzyme and growth factor antagonist properties is under way.
