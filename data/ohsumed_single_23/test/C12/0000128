Use of the double pigtail stent in stone retrieval following unsuccessful ureteroscopy.
 Insertion of a double pigtail stent is known to cause ureteric dilatation.
 We analysed the effect of an indwelling double pigtail stent on the success rate of calculus extraction by second ureteroscopy when the initial ureteroscopy fails.
 Over a 12-month period, a first ureteroscopy failed in 42 patients; 30 were then treated by ureteroscopy combined with a ureteric stent and 12 were treated without a ureteric stent.
 The group with an indwelling stent had a successful second ureteroscopy or spontaneously passed the calculus in 24 cases (84%) compared with 5 unstented cases (45%).
 Ureterolithotomy was necessary in 2 patients with a stent and 3 with no stent.
 It was concluded that following failed ureteroscopic manipulation of calculi, insertion of a double pigtail stent was associated with a higher subsequent success rate for removal of stone by ureteroscopy and a consequent lower rate of ureterolithotomy.
