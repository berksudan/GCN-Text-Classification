Use of biofeedback in treatment of psychogenic voiding dysfunction.
 A young man with psychologic problems and a long history of social inadequacy presented with voiding dysfunction.
 Videocystometrography revealed a normal filling phase and normal initiation of voiding interrupted by considerable straining by the patient and marked sphincter electromyographic (EMG) activity.
 Temporary amelioration was achieved by infiltration of the sphincter with lignocaine hydrochloride and by biofeedback therapy.
 In such cases optimal results are expected from long-term behavioral therapy.
