Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and progression of chronic renal failure.
 Renal failure, once established by loss of a critical amount of functional renal mass, tends to be progressive.
 A large body of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that glomerular capillary hypertension is important in the pathogenesis of progressive chronic renal failure of diverse types, including subtotal renal ablation and diabetic nephropathy.
 Converting enzyme inhibitors are effective in slowing or arresting the progression of glomerular injury in these experimental models, in association with normalization of both systemic and intrarenal pressures.
 Clinical studies of diabetic nephropathy and chronic renal failure of other etiologies support the concept that these same renal hemodynamic factors are important in human renal disease and that treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors may prove to be a useful therapeutic intervention.
 Whether the converting enzyme inhibitors have specific advantages over other antihypertensive agents due to beneficial renal hemodynamic effects, as suggested by experimental studies, is a question that awaits further investigation.
 Furthermore, the pathogenesis of hypertensive glomerular injury is complex and involves the participation of diverse biologic systems.
 We predict that a wide variety of therapeutic maneuvers, with disparate mechanisms of action, may be effective in arresting or preventing glomerular injury.
