Laser treatment of obstruction from incrusted ureteral catheter.
 Incrustations may develop on ureteral catheters and cause obstruction.
 We report a case in which obstruction was relieved by laser lithotripsy inside the lumen of the catheter.
 This completely noninvasive technique may prove to be useful in selected cases.
