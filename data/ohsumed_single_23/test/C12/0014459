Endopyelotomy for secondary ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children.
 Percutaneous endopyelotomy has been shown to be successful in treating ureteropelvic junction obstruction in adults.
 Little data have been published regarding this procedure in children.
 We describe 4 patients 6.5 weeks to 5.5 years old who underwent percutaneous endopyelotomy to treat ureteropelvic junction obstruction following failed open dismembered pyeloplasty.
 Preoperative obstruction was demonstrated by a nephrostogram, diuretic renogram and/or ultrasonography.
 Percutaneous endopyelotomy was successful in relieving the obstruction in all 4 patients, although 2 required secondary endoscopic procedures.
 One patient had persistent obstruction 40 days after endopyelotomy at the ureteropelvic junction and, subsequently, required percutaneous resection of a persistent flap of obstructing tissue.
 In another patient a ureterovesical stricture was noted at the time of stent removal, which was treated by endoscopic incision.
 All patients have been followed from 1.5 to 3 years postoperatively.
 Followup diuretic renograms, ultrasound and/or excretory urography demonstrated a patent ureteropelvic junction in all patients and all have remained asymptomatic.
 Endopyelotomy appears to be safe and effective in treating secondary ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children.
