Determination of the coefficient of kinetic friction of urinary catheter materials.
 The coefficient of kinetic friction plays an important role in the biocompatibility of urinary catheters.
 A method for determination of the in vivo coefficient of kinetic friction is described that allows the comparison of the catheter-urethral interaction of the various materials used in the production of urinary catheters and the different types of lubricants.
