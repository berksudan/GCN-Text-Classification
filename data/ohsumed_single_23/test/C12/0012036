Glomerular structures and lipids in progressive renal disease.
 In the last few years, remarkable advances have been made in the understanding of lipoprotein metabolism in the pathogenesis of renal disease in animal models and in vitro cell culture.
 Central to this work is the problem of the progression of renal disease in humans.
 This review recapitulates the theory (Lancet 1982; II: 1309-1312) that the progression of disease depends in part on the damage inflicted on the glomerulus by lipoproteins.
 The glomerular environment of high or low pressure, basement membrane damage, and destruction or damage of the mesangial and epithelial cells permits the filtration of protein, the consequence of which is hyperlipidemia.
 Whatever the therapeutic measures employed, if proteinuria persists, hyperlipidemia will follow.
 This suggest that lipoprotein toxicity may contribute to the final common path of renal damage in progressive renal disease.
 "Lipoprotein toxicity" in arteries is called atherosclerosis, but this term ignores the complexity of the glomerulus and the possible tubular damage that might be caused by filtered lipoprotein.
 It is clear there is insufficient knowledge of the metabolism of the damaged kidney to confidently attribute the pathology of progression of disease to any single process.
