Experience with a simplified technique for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence.
 Over a 9-year period a simple procedure for the correction of stress urinary incontinence was performed in 86 consecutive patients, 31 of whom had failed a previous anti-incontinence procedure.
 Success was achieved in 81 cases (94%).
 Of the 5 failures, 2 were successfully treated with a repeat procedure.
 Operative time ranged from 14 to 49 min (median 27).
 The average hospital stay was 2 days.
 Because of its simplicity and reliability, this technique is recommended for the surgical correction of female stress urinary incontinence.
