Donating a kidney to a family member. How primary care physicians can help prepare potential donors.
 When a relative needs a kidney to survive, family members often impulsively offer to donate one without stopping to consider the physical, emotional, and financial ramifications, which can be considerable.

 The authors discuss the things a potential kidney donor should consider.
