Study of bilateral histology and meiotic analysis in men undergoing varicocele ligation.
 Fifty men underwent testicular biopsy at the time of varicocele ligation.
 The biopsies were scored and also a portion from each biopsy was subjected to meiotic analysis.
 All men were followed up (mean follow-up 19.3 months).
 There were no consistent histologic or meiotic abnormalities, and there was no evidence that the varicocele side was more defective than the contralateral side.
 Thirteen pregnancies were recorded, and these occurred only when the mean Johnsen score from one or other testis was greater than 6.0.
