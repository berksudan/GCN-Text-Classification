Do extracorporeal shock waves affect urinary excretion of glycosaminoglycans?
 Urinary excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) was studied in 9 anaesthetised dogs and 10 patients with single kidneys.
 The animals were studied for 4 to 5 hours after administration of shock waves to 1 kidney, the contralateral organ serving as control.
 Urinary excretion of GAGs was measured on both sides.
 The patients were studied 0 to 24 and 32 to 56 h after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).
 In the animals an increased mean urinary excretion of GAGs was observed on both sides; this was more marked in the treated kidney.
 The increase reflects tissue injury in the exposed kidney induced by the extracorporeal shock waves.
 No increase in mean urinary excretion of GAGs was observed in the patients.
