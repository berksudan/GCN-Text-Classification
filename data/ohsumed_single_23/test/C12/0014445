Vacuum tumescence devices: the role of papaverine in the selection of patients.
 We conducted a prospective study to determine the positive predictive value of papaverine testing to select patients in whom a vacuum constriction device would be a successful alternative to operative management of impotence.
 A total of 30 men presenting to an impotence clinic was evaluated with a series of papaverine dosages up to 60 mg.
 These patients then received a physician-administered trial of a vacuum constriction device, followed by 3 months of home use and a repeat objective evaluation.
 Initial responses to the device were poor, with 46% of the patients (14) achieving a rigid erection.
 However, after 3 months of home use 83% of the patients (25) achieved a rigid erection.
 The positive predictive value of a good response to the papaverine trial was 94%.
