Endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux in children with neurogenic bladders.
 Endoscopic subureteral injection of Teflon was performed in 12 children (20 ureters) with neurogenic bladders and vesicoureteral reflux (grades III-IV).
 Follow-up evaluation by ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrogram at three-month intervals up to two years revealed successful correction of the reflux in 70 percent of the ureters.
