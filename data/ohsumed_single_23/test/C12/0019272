Small artery resistance increases during the development of renal hypertension.
 Vascular pressures were measured in the principal (A1) arteriole and in upstream small arteries of the rat cremaster muscle to investigate vascular resistance changes associated with one-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertension.
 Pressure measurements were made at a proximal and distal site of each vessel using a servonull micropipette system.
 Vessel diameters were measured using video microscopy.
 A1 arteriole and external spermatic artery diameters were both decreased after 2 and 4 weeks of hypertension.
 Mean arterial pressure was elevated after 2 weeks of hypertension (106 +/- 4 mm Hg versus 140 +/- 5 mm Hg).
 Likewise, vascular pressures were elevated at every site: pudicepigastric artery (36%), external spermatic artery (47%), and A1 arteriole (38%).
 The pressure drop along the external spermatic artery was increased (87%) after 2 weeks of hypertension.
 Mean arterial pressure was further elevated from 2-4 weeks of hypertension (105 +/- 4 mm Hg versus 162 +/- 7 mm Hg) but only the proximal pudic-epigastric artery pressure was further elevated during this time from 2 to 4 weeks (131 +/- 5 mm Hg versus 147 +/- 7 mm Hg) of hypertension development.
 This was associated with an increased pressure drop (87%) along the artery compared with the situation at 2 weeks.
 These data indicate that small arteries upstream from the microcirculation contribute significantly to the increase in vascular resistance during hypertension.
 In addition, these data indicate that the increases in small artery resistance do not develop uniformly throughout all vessel branches.
