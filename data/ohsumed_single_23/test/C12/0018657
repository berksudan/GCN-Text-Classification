Preliminary experience with the pulsed dye laser for treatment of urolithiasis.
 We report our initial experience using the pulsed dye laser in 26 patients with urolithiasis.
 The patients ranged in age from 27 to 82 years; 11 patients were female and 15 were male.
 Of the 26 patients, 4 stones were in the kidney, 21 were in the ureter, and one was in the bladder.
 Surgical time ranged from 32 to 130 minutes.
 All patients were treated under spinal or general anesthesia.
 The size of ureteral stones ranged from 0.2 to 1.5 cm, and the renal stones 3.0 to 4.0 cm.
 Chemical analysis of the stones was not available on all patients, but when available, chemical analysis revealed the stones to be calcium monohydrate, calcium dihydrate, or struvite.
 The use of the Candela miniscope in 11 patients permitted access without ureteral dilation.
 In 19 patients, ureteral stents were placed.
 One patient suffered a ureteral perforation.
 Success was defined as adequate disintegration of the stone for passage of the fragments without the necessity of a secondary procedure.
 Using this criterion, 22 of 26 patients were successfully treated for an overall success rate of 85%.
