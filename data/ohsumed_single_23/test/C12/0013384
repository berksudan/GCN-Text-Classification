The concentrations of transferrin, beta 2-microglobulin, and albumin in seminal plasma in relation to sperm count.
 A number of studies have shown a relationship between transferrin levels in seminal plasma and sperm count.
 In the present study, the levels of transferrin, beta 2-microglobulin and albumin were measured in 171 samples of seminal plasma (50 subjects with normal sperm count; 32 with azoospermia; 49 with oligozoospermia; 10 with polyzoospermia; and 31 vasectomized).
 All three proteins were related to sperm count.
 It is concluded that there is a general relationship between seminal plasma proteins and sperm numbers and that some products of the sperm themselves must control the entry of plasma proteins into seminal plasma.
