Management of staghorn stones using a combination of lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy and Solution R irrigation.
 The treatment of staghorn and partial staghorn calculi remains complex despite modern methods of stone removal.
 We describe the results following treatment of 112 stones.
 Three methods were used: percutaneous nephrolithotomy, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy and Solution R irrigation, either alone or in combination; 57 stones (55.8%) were completely cleared, with Solution R irrigation helping to achieve complete clearance in 6 of these.
 A further 24 stones were not completely cleared (small asymptomatic fragments less than 3 mm remained).
 A satisfactory outcome (stone-free or asymptomatic fragments less than 3 mm) was achieved in 81 stones (79%).
