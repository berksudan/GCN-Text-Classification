The radiographic spectrum of renal osteodystrophy.
 Chronic renal failure often results in bone changes, collectively known as renal osteodystrophy.
 These changes include osteitis fibrosa, osteosclerosis, soft tissue calcifications, osteomalacia (in adults) and rickets (in children).
 Early recognition of renal osteodystrophy allows more aggressive clinical control of serum calcium and phosphate levels.
 Intervention may spare the patient late complications such as fractures, pain and loss of skeletal function.
