Role of 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors in the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma.
 Everything we know about the biology of the prostate supports the concept that DHT is the obligate androgen responsible for normal and hyperplastic growth.
 Whether this selectivity is maintained during malignant transformation is unknown.
 The consistent emergence of androgen-insensitive disease highlights the spectrum of biologic evolution this cancer is capable of.
 If the tumor is dependent only on DHT for neoplastic growth, the unique characteristics of a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor offer several potential actions that warrant a systematic evaluation.
