The effect of radiation therapy and hyperthermia on a human prostatic carcinoma cell line grown in athymic nude mice.
 The effect of radiation and/or hyperthermia on a human prostatic carcinoma xenograft in athymic nude mice was investigated.
 A human prostate carcinoma subline (1-LN-PC-3-1A) was inoculated subcutaneously in the thigh of male athymic nude mice.
 When tumors reached a size of approximately 200 mm.3, they were treated with either radiation (X) or hyperthermia (H) alone, or in combination (X + H).
 In the combined treatment, hyperthermia was delivered immediately after radiation exposure.
 Comparison of the time required to reach twice the tumor volume observed at the time of treatment was used to define therapeutic impact on tumor growth.
 The combined treatment resulted in median tumor volume doubling time of 35.5 days, compared to 18 days and 25.5 days, respectively, for hyperthermia or radiation alone.
 Analysis of tumor doubling time using a proportional hazards regression indicates that under the conditions of this experiment, the effect of radiation and hyperthermia for 1-LN-PC-3-1A tumors is additive.
 The impact of this treatment regimen in the management of prostatic cancer requires further investigation.
