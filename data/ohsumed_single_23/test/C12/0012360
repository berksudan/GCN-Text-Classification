Semen analysis in patients operated on for impalpable testes.
 Semen analysis was performed on 48 men who had undergone orchiopexy, 40 for unilateral impalpable testes and 8 for bilateral impalpable testes.
 Patients with unilateral impalpable testes had varying sperm analysis; 18 (86%) of the 23 patients with unilateral impalpable canalicular testes had normal sperm analysis.
 All patients with bilateral impalpable testes were azoospermic.
 The subsequent quality of the semen is dependent upon the original anatomical positions of the undescended testes.
