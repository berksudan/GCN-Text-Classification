Incontinence management scale for elderly inpatient men.
 For many elderly inpatients, urinary incontinence cannot be successfully treated and the management objective is identifying a suitable method for containment of urine loss.
 In elderly inpatient men, an external catheter is utilized in many cases for incontinence management.
 The role of the severity of incontinence and the use of an external catheter was investigated in 66 elderly inpatient men.
 Quantitative incontinence measurements showed incontinent patients having an external catheter had approximately 6.3 (SD = 2.5) episodes per day compared with 3.2 (SD = 2.0) episodes per day in the noncatheter incontinent patients.
 The clinical management method used in these patients was associated with the measured severity of incontinence.
