Preservation of renal reserve in chronic renal disease.
 Protein-induced increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), termed renal reserve, is said to be abrogated with the onset of renal disease.
 However, this notion is inconsistent with the results from animal studies which suggest that alterations in protein intake modulate the glomerular hemodynamics in experimental renal disease.
 Accordingly, 12 normal subjects and 15 patients with renal disease received a protein meal providing 1 g/kg body weight protein.
 The subjects were pretreated with either placebo or an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril.
 A significant (P less than 0.05) increase in inulin and para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance was noted in normal subjects as well as in patients with renal disease.
 The increase in GFR over basal values in normal subjects (28 +/- 9%), patients with moderate renal failure (20 +/- 13%), and advanced renal failure (21 +/- 14%) was not different.
 Plasma renin activity was unchanged following protein meal in the placebo studies although it increased following enalapril administration.
 Enalapril pretreatment did not alter the glomerular vasodilation and hyperfiltration following protein meal.
 We conclude that protein meal induces glomerular hyperfiltration in renal disease and that this protein-induced hyperfiltration is not mediated by angiotensin II.
 Because glomerular hyperfiltration is implicated in the progression of renal disease, these data suggest that even in patients who have advanced renal failure, high-protein diets may exert a detrimental effect on the kidney.
