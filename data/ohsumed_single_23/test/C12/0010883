Distribution of endogenous albumin in the glomerular wall of proteinuric patients.
 Glomerular proteinuria seems to be related, in part, to loss or impairment of the normal barrier function of the glomerular capillary wall.
 To investigate the functional properties of this barrier, endogenous albumin was revealed in the glomerular wall of proteinuric patients and compared with a nonproteinuric control by immunoelectron microscopy using the protein A-gold method.
 In the control biopsy, peaks of albumin accumulation were noted in the subendothelial area and in the inner portion of the lamina densa, with gradual tapering of the distribution toward the epithelial side of the basement membrane.
 The urinary space and epithelial cells were weakly labeled.
 In tissues from proteinuric patients, albumin was distributed throughout the entire width of the glomerular basement membrane, although the pattern of accumulation varied between patients.
 The urinary space showed significant labeling associated with some flocculent material.
 Mesangial areas were heavily labeled in tissues from both control and proteinuric patients.
 In the latter, lysozomes in glomerular and tubular epithelial cells also accumulated albumin, which is evidence of reabsorption.
 These results reveal the existence, in normal conditions, of a barrier located in the subendothelial area of the glomerular basement membrane, the loss of which, as in the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, leads to diffuse distribution of albumin in the glomerular capillary wall.
