Do stone formers have lower urinary fibrinolytic activity than controls?
 A comparison of urinary fibrinolytic activity between 31 stone formers and 50 controls failed to demonstrate any significant difference and so failed to confirm an earlier independent observation.
 This may be due to methodological and design differences between the 2 studies, but does suggest reservations about the significance of lowered urinary fibrinolytic activity as a risk factor for renal stone disease.
 Dietary information from those taking part in the study suggests that a reduction of meat intake by stone formers might be associated with increased urinary fibrinolytic activity.
 This might account for the discrepancy between the 2 studies, in which case this observation could be of significance.
