Management of upper tract calculi in patients with tubularized urinary diversions.
 In a retrospective review of patients with urinary diversion who presented to our stone center during a 3.5-year period 9 underwent 20 procedures for suspected stone episodes.
 Eventual outcome was excellent in all but 1 patient.
 In particular, all attempts at retrograde trans-stomal manipulation were successful.
 We present our cases, and note the technical considerations and management principles.
 Frequently, these patients are best served by a combination of percutaneous antegrade, trans-stomal retrograde and/or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.
