Kinetic modeling of intracellular pH and comparison with 31P NMR experimental values in dialysed uremic patients.
 Changes in intra-erythrocytic pH values over time, during and after bicarbonate hemodialysis, were studied with 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.
 Simultaneously, pH values of whole blood were obtained by a gazometric method.
 A two-compartment model appeared to be the simplest kinetic model to explain the shifts in proton concentrations in extra- and intra-cellular media.
 Non-linear regression was used to determine exchange constant values.
 There was a very good correlation between the experimental and calculated proton concentrations.
 This model can describe all patients but individual experimental constants must be determined.
 Under these conditions a single blood pH determination before dialysis will permit determination of the initial intra-erythrocytic pH and monitoring of intra-erythrocytic pH during hemodialysis.
