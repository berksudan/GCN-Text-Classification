Treatment of steinstrasse with repeat extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy: experience with piezoelectric lithotriptor.
 Among 958 patients with renal stones who underwent extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) monotherapy using an EDAP-LT01 piezoelectric lithotriptor steinstrasse developed in 55 (5.7%).
 Of these 55 cases stone fragments passed spontaneously in 35 (63.6%) and were treated successfully (no residual stone fragment in ureter) with repeat ESWL in 18 (32.8%).
 Only 2 patients (3.6%) required ureteroscopic management or open ureterolithotomy.
 Therefore, repeat ESWL is considered a good initial method to treat complicated steinstrasse.
