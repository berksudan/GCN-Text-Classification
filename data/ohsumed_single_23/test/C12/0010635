Post-traumatic priapism treated with metaraminol bitartrate: case report.
 A 30-year-old male with post-traumatic priapism for 7 days was treated successfully by metaraminol bitartrate injection into the corpus cavernosum.
 This result suggests that an alpha-adrenagic agent injection into the corpus cavernosum should be considered in post-traumatic priapism at first.
