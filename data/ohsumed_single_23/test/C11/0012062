Prevalence of lattice degeneration and its relation to axial length in severe myopia.
 We studied 436 eyes of 218 patients with myopia of -6.00 diopters or more in both eyes.
 Of 218 patients, 72 (33.0%) had lattice degeneration of the retina.
 Among these 72 patients, lattice lesions were uniocular in 39 (54.2%) and binocular in 33 (45.8%).
 Of 105 males, 33 (31.4%) had lattice degeneration; of 113 females, 39 (34.5%) had lattice degeneration.
 Contrary to previously published data, we found an inverse relationship between axial length and the prevalence of lattice degeneration in severely myopic eyes.
 The greatest prevalence of lattice degeneration (63 of 154 eyes, 40.9%) was found in eyes with an axial length of 26.0 to 26.9 mm (-6.00 to -8.70 diopters), and the least prevalence of lattice degeneration (five of 71 eyes, 7.0%) was found in eyes with an axial length of 32.0 mm (-24.00 diopters) or greater.
 This may explain the observation that retinal detachment after cataract surgery has been noted more commonly among patients with moderate than severe myopia.
