The management of chalazion: a survey of Ontario ophthalmologists.
 Owing to the variability and lack of standardization of chalazion management, a survey of Ontario ophthalmologists was undertaken.
 The results highlight what ophthalmologists consider to be problems in chalazion management and suggest that a chalazion operation should be treated with the same respect given any other operation.
