Injector for highly viscous silicone oil.
 A syringe device for the injection and evacuation of highly viscous silicone oil was developed.
 The problem of removing the air interfering with these manoeuvres was solved by providing special outlets in the plunger and handle of a conventional glass syringe.
 A slightly modified commercial motor perfusor was chosen to power this device, which has proved to be good and fail-safe in more than 100 cases.
