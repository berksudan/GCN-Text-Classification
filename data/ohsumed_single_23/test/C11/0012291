Clear ultraviolet blocking lenses for use by PUVA patients.
 It is well recognized that patients receiving photochemotherapy (PUVA) need to wear UV-blocking sunglasses on the day of ingestion of 8-methoxypsoralen.
 For many patients the wearing of tinted sun-glasses causes difficulties because they interfere with colour perception, reduce definition in conditions of low background light and often because they are considered 'cosmetically unacceptable'.
 In this study the UV-blocking properties of a number of lenses with little or no tint were assessed.
 The following lenses or lens coatings were found to be suitable for use by PUVA patients: Orcolite UV 400, Orma UVX, Rodenstock Lambda 400, Sola UV Gard 400 and Polaroid polarizing lenses.
