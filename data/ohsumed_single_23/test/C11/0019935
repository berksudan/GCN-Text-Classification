Therapeutic ultrasound for the treatment of glaucoma [published erratum appears in Am J Ophthalmol 1991 Jul 15;112(1):105]
 A multicenter clinical trial of therapeutic ultrasound for the treatment of glaucoma included 20 centers in the United States in which 1,117 treatments were performed on 880 eyes.
 The study was limited to patients with refractory glaucoma who had not benefited from conventional medical and surgical techniques.
 Approximately 782 of 1,117 treatments (70%) showed an initial decrease in intraocular pressure from a pretreatment mean of 38.1 mm Hg to 22 mm Hg or less.
 By Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the single treatment success rate (intraocular pressure between 6 and 22 mm Hg) was 48.7% at six months posttreatment.
 When retreatment was used subsequent to failure, the one-year multitreatment success rate was 79.3%.
 The most common complications were an immediate posttreatment intraocular pressure increase lasting a few hours and mild iritis.
 Other complications included scleral thinning in 28 of 1,117 treatments (2.5%) and phthisis bulbi in 12 of 1,117 treatments (1.1%).
