Effect of a beta-blocker on altered body position: induced ocular hypertension.
 The intraocular pressures (IOP) were measured in both eyes of 25 healthy volunteers in various body positions.
 One eye was pretreated with levobunolol 0.5% or placebo applied in a masked, randomised fashion, while the other served as control.
 IOP changes in response to levobunolol and to changes in position were significant (p less than 0.0001).
 However, pressure rises relative to position were not significantly different in eyes treated with drug vs placebo.
 Levobunolol did not alter relative changes in IOP from changes in body position.
 However, the overall lowering effect may offer some protection to patients with glaucoma.
