Mast cell numbers and staining characteristics in the normal and allergic human conjunctiva.
 In this study we report the numbers and metachromatic dye-staining characteristics of mast cells (MCs) in the conjunctiva of normal subjects and patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis caused by pollenosis.
 In addition, we have used a monoclonal antibody to the MC-specific enzyme, tryptase, to enumerate tryptase-positive cells immunohistochemically.
 Tarsal conjunctival MCs were found to be present in increased numbers in the allergic compared to the nonallergic subjects.
 Most of the MCs exhibited staining that was formaldehyde resistant, compatible with their identification as connective tissue MCs or basophils.
 The high positive staining for tryptase confirmed that the metachromatic cells stained with toluidine blue were MCs and not basophils, both in normal and allergic subjects.
