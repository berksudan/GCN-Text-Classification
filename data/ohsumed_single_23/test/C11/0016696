Quantitative analysis of lens changes after vitrectomy by fluorophotometry.
 We measured the amount of autofluorescence in the lens to evaluate quantitatively lens changes after vitrectomy.
 Thirteen phakic patients, ranging in age from 12 to 75 years, were studied after unilateral vitrectomy, with a follow-up period of more than two years (range, 26 to 55 months).
 Autofluorescence in the lens was measured at the center along the ocular axis by fluorophotometry.
 Lens autofluorescence in the eyes that underwent vitrectomy was significantly higher than in the contralateral eyes that were not operated on (P = .0003).
 The increase of autofluorescence was correlated significantly with the age at time of vitrectomy (P = .0008).
 There was no correlation between the increase in autofluorescence and the length of postoperative follow-up or the use of air during vitrectomy.
 Based on these results, we believe that oxidation of lens proteins intraoperatively may be one of the causes of development of nuclear cataract after vitrectomy.
