Aphakic visual fields by automated perimetry.
 Accurate testing of the visual field of aphakic patients is demanding due to the optical distortion induced by high plus corrective lenses.
 This testing procedure can be improved by using an aspheric contact lens instead of a full-aperture loose trial lens.
 We found that the contact lens enhances the ability of the pattern-deviation printout of the Statpac analysis to identify glaucomatous visual field abnormalities in program 30-2 of the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer.
