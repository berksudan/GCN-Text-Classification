Hereditary hemorrhagic macular dystrophy.
 We treated two brothers who had a hemorrhagic macular lesion in one eye; a similar problem affected the fellow eye of both patients within eight months.
 Generalized fine granularity of the retinal pigment epithelium and peripheral iris transillumination defects were observed in both siblings.
 A study of the family suggested that the disorder was dominantly inherited and probably was Sorsby's pseudoinflammatory macular dystrophy.
 The macular lesions in one brother were treated by argon green laser photocoagulation and in the other brother by krypton red laser photocoagulation.
 Although the brother treated by krypton red laser photocoagulation attained better final visual function, additional differences in treatment methods also may have contributed to the final outcome.
