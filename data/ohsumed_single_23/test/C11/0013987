The relationship of visual acuity, refractive error, and pupil size after radial keratotomy.
 To better define the relationship between residual refractive error, uncorrected visual acuity, and pupil diameter, we compared 42 eyes that had an eight-incision radial keratotomy according to the Prospective Evaluation of Radial Keratotomy Study protocol with 42 matched control eyes.
 The parameters measured were best corrected visual acuity, uncorrected visual acuity, and the change in cycloplegic refraction with enlarging pupil diameter.
 The best corrected visual acuity was 20/16 in both the radial keratotomy and control groups, but the variability (SD) was higher in the radial keratotomy group.
 The average uncorrected visual acuity was 0.35 (35%) better in the radial keratotomy group, but the variability was 1.77 times higher.
 Change in refraction with dilation occurred in 9% of the controls and 36% of the radial keratotomy patients, indicating a significant difference (P = .002).
 The change in refraction with dilation in the eyes with radial keratotomy was almost equally split between a hyperopic change (17%) and a myopic change (18%), which was much different than in the control eyes, only 2% of which changed in a hyperopic direction and 7% in a myopic direction.
 The radial keratotomy patients with a myopic change had the best uncorrected visual acuity, indicating that positive spherical aberration yielded the best aspherical surface for uncorrected visual acuity.
