Diode laser trabeculoplasty (DLT) for primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.
 A pilot study has been carried out to examine the efficacy of diode laser trabeculoplasty in the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.
 The device used was portable and could be attached to a standard slit-lamp microscope.
 Powers of 0.8-1.2 W were used, with a spot size of 100 microns and a pulse of 0.20 second.
 Laser trabeculoplasty carried out on 20 eyes for glaucoma resulted in a mean ocular hypotensive effect of 10.2 mmHG at two weeks after treatment and of 9.55 mmHg at 6 months.
 It is concluded that diode laser trabeculoplasty is an effective mode of treatment for eyes with open-angle glaucoma or with ocular hypertension.
