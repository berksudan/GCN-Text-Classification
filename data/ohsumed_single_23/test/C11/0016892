Autogenous fascial grafts for exposed retinal buckles.
 Three patients with exposed scleral buckling elements received autogenous fascial grafts as an alternative to buckle removal.
 All three patients had successful coverage of their scleral buckles.
 There were no redetachments or infections.
 One patient had a postoperative ptosis that required repair.
 Autogenous fascial grafts are useful procedures in patients with exposed retinal buckles who have a significant risk of retinal redetachment with buckle removal.
