Semiconductor diode laser photocoagulation in retinal vascular disease.
 The authors successfully performed clinical transpupillary retinal photocoagulation in 30 eyes of 26 patients with retinal vascular disease using a gallium-aluminium-arsenide (GaAlAs) diode laser emitting at 805 nm.
 Retinal photocoagulation was performed at treatment powers of 300 to 1300 mW and exposure durations of 0.2 to 0.5 seconds with a 200-microns diameter treatment spot.
 Patients treated with both diode and argon green lasers required 4.5 +/- 1.8 times greater mean laser energy with diode compared with argon to create ophthalmoscopically similar lesions.
 Parallel experimental retinal photocoagulation in Chinchilla rabbits required 3.1 +/- 0.9 times more power to create ophthalmoscopically similar lesions with the diode laser than with the argon laser.
 Intraoperative subretinal hemorrhage occurred rarely in patients with an incidence of 4 (0.44%) of 9021 treatment spots.
 Patients complained of moderate-to-marked pain in 10 (43%) of 23 treatments initiated under topical anesthesia.
 A transpupillary diode laser may be used clinically to perform therapeutic retinal photocoagulation.
