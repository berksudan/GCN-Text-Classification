Correlation between intraocular pressure control and progressive glaucomatous damage in primary open-angle glaucoma.
 Fifty-five patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and early glaucomatous damage who had medical therapy and laser trabeculoplasty were followed up for four to 11 years or until progressive glaucomatous damage was documented.
 Factors associated with the stability or progression of glaucoma were evaluated.
 Eyes with mean intraocular pressure higher than 21 mm Hg during the follow-up period uniformly had progressive glaucomatous changes.
 Conversely, eyes with mean intraocular pressure less than 17 mm Hg remained stable, and approximately half of the eyes with mean intraocular pressure between 17 and 21 mm Hg had progressive glaucomatous changes.
 Patients who remained stable were slightly younger than those with progressive glaucomatous changes (P less than .05), but initial optic nerve head appearance, initial visual field findings, number of medicines used, medical history, and patient gender or race were not statistically associated with stability or progression of the glaucoma.
 These findings reinforce the importance of intraocular pressure control in primary open-angle glaucoma and the need to identify other markers that help determine the proper level of intraocular pressure for individual patients.
