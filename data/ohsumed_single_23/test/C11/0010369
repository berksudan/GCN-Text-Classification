Inflammatory mediators in postoperative aphakic and pseudophakic baboon eyes.
 We measured prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 in the aqueous humor of baboon eyes, 1 or 8 days after phacoemulsification, with or without posterior chamber lens implantation.
 We also evaluated the effects of steroid eye drops and cyclooxygenase inhibitor eye drops on the synthesis of these mediators of inflammation.
 Eyes that had undergone phacoemulsification showed significant elevation of prostaglandin E2 at both postoperative periods compared with normal, phakic control eyes.
 The level of prostaglandin E2 was significantly (P less than .05) higher in eyes with posterior chamber lens implantation than in those without it, and was significantly (P less than .05) higher on the eighth than on the first postoperative day.
 The amount of leukotriene B4 was below the detection limit, except in the few eyes in which complications developed.
 Cyclooxygenase inhibitor eye drops significantly reduced the amount of prostaglandin E2 on both postoperative days, while steroid eye drops had no such effect.
