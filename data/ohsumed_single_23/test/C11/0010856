The potential for mental status changes associated with systemic absorption of anticholinergic ophthalmic medications: concerns in the elderly.
 Several cases have been reported of anticholinergic toxicity following the administration of commonly used parasympatholytic cycloplegics and mydriatics.
 Cases have been reported in children, adults, and the elderly.
 The risk of developing mental status changes secondary to anticholinergic ophthalmic medications is of particular concern in the elderly.
 Drug-induced mental status or behavior changes should not be mistaken for exacerbation of an underlying disorder or the onset of a new disease (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, dementia).
 Clinicians should be aware of these potential complications, monitor for changes in mental status, and take appropriate action.
