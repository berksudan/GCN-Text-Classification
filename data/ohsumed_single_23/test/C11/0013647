Cyclocryotherapy in selected cases of congenital glaucoma.
 We investigated the efficacy of cyclocryotherapy, a procedure which destroys the ciliary epithelium, thereby decreasing the production of aqueous humor, by retrospectively studying 109 eyes with advanced primary congenital glaucoma that had undergone the procedure.
 The eyes were divided into two groups: group I comprised 75 eyes (69%) that had undergone conventional surgical procedures for congenital glaucoma prior to cyclocryotherapy; group II, 34 eyes (31%) that had not undergone any such previous procedures.
 All eyes were followed for at least 12 months after the last cyclocryotherapy.
 With "success" defined as "having an IOP greater than or equal to 8 mmHg, greater than or equal to 19 mmHg with or without medication," the success rate in all eyes was 30%, with no significant difference between the success rates in groups I and II (P greater than .05).
 Chronic hypotony (IOP less than 8 mmHg) was found in seven eyes (6%).
 Six eyes (6%) developed cataract during the course of treatment with cyclocryotherapy.
 Cyclocryotherapy appears to be a reasonable addition to the treatment of eyes with advanced, uncontrolled, primary congenital glaucoma.
