Light damage in detached retina.
 We injected homologous fibroblasts over the retinal vascular wing in five rabbits to induce a tractional retinal detachment.
 Eleven days later, a focal area of detachment was exposed to 30 minutes of visible light by an intraocular fiberoptic probe.
 Histologic damage to the detached retina exposed to light was demonstrated.
 The outer retina was affected most severely.
