Effects of antiflammins on endotoxin-induced uveitis in rats.
 Antiflammins are phospholipase A2-inhibitory, anti-inflammatory, synthetic oligopeptides derived from the region of the highest amino-acid sequence similarity between uteroglobin and lipocortin I.
 Endotoxin-induced uveitis is a model for anterior uveitis of the eye, which has been suggested to be induced through phospholipase A2 activation.
 In a preliminary report we demonstrated that topical administration of antiflammins could inhibit endotoxin-induced uveitis in rats.
 In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of antiflammins were compared with those of corticosteroids on endotoxin-induced uveitis as measured by phospholipase A2 enzyme activity, inflammatory cell counts in the aqueous humor, and histopathologic features.
 Antiflammins are as effective as corticosteroids in their ability to suppress endotoxin-induced uveitis.
