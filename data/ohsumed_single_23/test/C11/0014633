Treatment of exophthalmos.
 Current procedures for Graves' exophthalmos fail to achieve complete correction.
 The standard orbital decompressions were therefore modified to maximize the degree of volumetric increase behind the axis of the globe.
 In 15 orbits, the preoperative exophthalmos averaged 9.5 mm, whereas the postoperative exophthalmos was 4.1 mm.
 Postoperative CT study demonstrated that the remaining posterior orbital wall, combined with the persistently increased intraocular muscle volume, blocked retrodisplacement of the globe, despite adequate total volumetric increase.
 The increased muscle volume varied from 2 to 5 cc.
 Despite this residual exophthalmos, the modified four-wall expansion provides excellent aesthetic results with visual improvement and resolution of chemosis and exposure keratitis.
