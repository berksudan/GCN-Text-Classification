Safety of same-day sequential extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and dissolution of gallstones by methyl tert-butyl ether in dogs.
 Passage of stone fragments after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of gallstones has resulted in biliary colic, duct obstruction, and pancreatitis in some patients.
 Rapid dissolution of these fragments with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) may prevent such side effects and achieve complete clearance of gallstones within hours rather than several months to a year or longer.
 This study examines the safety of same-day ESWL fragmentation and MTBE dissolution of surgically implanted human gallstones in 15 dogs.
 The animals were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups to assess MTBE absorption from the gallbladder and to observe hematology and chemistry profiles after 0, 400, and 1,200 shock waves from a lithotriptor followed by MTBE dissolution therapy.
 They were sacrificed either immediately after treatment (12 dogs) or 2 weeks later (3 dogs).
 The results demonstrated that although ESWL causes moderate trauma to the gallbladder, this did not result in increased MTBE absorption or histologic evidence of mucosal disruption.
 Blood profiles demonstrated an increase in only the level of aspartate aminotransferase.
 The three dogs that were sacrificed 2 weeks after the combined treatment had no residual evidence of gallbladder injury or remaining stone material.
 In all animals, severe injury occurred where shock waves passed through lung or air-filled colon.
 This study suggests that same-day sequential fragmentation of gallstones by ESWL followed by dissolution of stone fragments with use of MTBE may be associated with only mild to moderate and reversible gallbladder trauma and can rapidly achieve clearance of gallstones.
