Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in pancreas divisum.
 Until recently, pancreas divisum represented a major technical barrier to a complete evaluation of pancreatic ductal anatomy.
 Technical refinements have now made it possible to achieve minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in more than 90% of attempts.
 In 120 consecutive dorsal ductograms, structural pathology was demonstrated in 36 subjects (30%): chronic pancreatitis in 23, pancreatic stones in 10, pseudocyst(s) in 4, ductal "cut-off" in 7, pancreatic cancer in 3, and partial agenesis in 1 (some patients had more than one finding).
 For patients in whom alcohol abuse was excluded, ductal pathology was present in 25%.
 Abnormal ventral ductograms were present in only 8% of cases, demonstrating that dorsal ductography has an appreciable additional diagnostic yield.
 When the clinical situation indicates the need for pancreatography, minor papilla cannulation should be performed if major papilla cannulation fails or reveals only the ventral pancreatogram of pancreas divisum.
