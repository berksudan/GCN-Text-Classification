Supportive evidence for the validity of the epidemiologic necropsy for gallstones 
 OBJECTIVE: The epidemiologic necropsy measures the occurrence of unsuspected disease through the examination of necropsy records of patients who died for other reasons.
 The estimates of unsuspected disease derived from the epidemiologic necropsy should approximate what actually occurs in the living population.
 DESIGN/SETTING: To test this hypothesis, all necropsy records of adult patients at the University of Kansas Medical Center from 1950 to 1984 were examined for the presence of gallstones.
 Patients with previous cholecystectomy or whose gallstones were diagnosed during life were excluded.
 The data were stratified by age and race and compared with those of a screening survey from Canada, a surgical series from New York, two screening surveys from Italy, and one from Denmark.
 The crude necropsy detection rates and the rates from the screening surveys were standardized to the 1970 federal census for Kansas City.
 RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The standardized occurrence rates were similar and suggest that the epidemiologic necropsy accurately assesses the occurrence of asymptomatic gallstones in the living population, thus strengthening its validity as a research tool.
