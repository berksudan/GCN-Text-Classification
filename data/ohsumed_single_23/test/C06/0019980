Training, credentialling, and granting of clinical privileges for laparoscopic general surgery.
 Despite the lack of scientific data comparing it with traditional open operations, laparoscopic surgery has gained rapid acceptance and implementation by general surgeons.
 Individual hospitals, which have the responsibility for developing their own privileging criteria, are searching for guidance as to the amount and type of additional training required to grant clinical privileges in laparoscopic general surgery.
 Laparoscopic surgery involves techniques different from those learned during general surgery residency training.
 Therefore, until such techniques are regularly included in general surgery residency programs, additional training for and granting of separate privileges in laparoscopic surgery are appropriate.
 Adequate training for surgeons already experienced in abdominal and biliary tract surgery can be acquired through a preceptorship in diagnostic laparoscopy, attending a course in laparoscopic surgery that includes both didactic instruction and live animal experience, assisting with the procedures in humans, and being proctored and certified as competent by an experienced general surgeon.
