Rectopexy is an ineffective treatment for obstructed defecation.
 The symptoms of obstructed defecation have been attributed to rectal intussusception, and thus rectopexy has been advocated in the surgical management.
 In this study, patients with obstructed defecation underwent manometry and proctography before and after rectopexy.
 Seventeen patients (16 females and one male, mean age 51.6 years) were studied.
 Eleven underwent anterior and posterior fixation of the rectum and six had posterior fixation only.
 Preoperatively five patients demonstrated rectoanal intussusceptions.
 Fifteen had significant pelvic descent.
 No significant change in maximum resting pressure, maximum voluntary contraction, pelvic descent, or anorectal angle was seen postoperatively.
 In the initial follow-up, many patients had significant amelioration of symptoms.
 However, on longer follow-up (mean 30.8 months) only two had long-term improvement.
 The remainder had a poor clinical result in spite of complete resolution of rectal intussusception.
 Many reported a worsening of symptoms as reflected by an increase in tenesmus and stool frequency.
 In the two cases with a satisfactory result, both could empty the rectum completely and demonstrated rectoanal intussusception on preoperative evacuation proctography.
 In those with poor results, four had complete emptying and three had rectoanal intussusception.
 In conclusion rectopexy is an ineffective treatment for obstructive defecation in most patients.
