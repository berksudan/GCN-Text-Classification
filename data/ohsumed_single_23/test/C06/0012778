Congenital hepatic fibrosis in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease.
 Congenital hepatic fibrosis was found in four families with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease.
 Congenital hepatic fibrosis is commonly though to be characteristic for autosomal-recessive polycystic kidney disease, but the reported families, show that it can also complicate autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease.
 In three families close linkage between the mutation causing the disease and DNA markers on chromosome 16 was demonstrated.
 The clinical course of the congenital hepatic fibrosis differed considerably; in one family the children with congenital hepatic fibrosis died soon after birth, in the three other families an approximately 20 years follow-up showed no detectable progression of the liver disease.
