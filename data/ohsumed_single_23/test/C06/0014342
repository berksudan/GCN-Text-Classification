Quantification of hepatobiliary function as an integral part of imaging with technetium-99m-mebrofenin in health and disease.
 A study was undertaken to check the feasibility of measuring the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) and excretion T-1/2 values as an integral part of hepatobiliary imaging with technetium-99m-mebrofenin in health and disease.
 In 18 controls subjects, the HEF was 100% and the T-1/2 excretion mean +/- s.e.
 value was 15.23 +/- 1.4 min.
 The mean appearance times of the common bile duct (CBD), gallbladder (GB), and small intestine were 15.8 +/- 1.52, 20.2 +/- 2.7, and 23.8 +/- 3.08 min, respectively.
 Rising serum bilirubin in patients decreased HEF and increased T-1/2 excretion value resulting in delayed appearance of CBD, GB, and small intestine.
 In control subjects and patients with bilirubin less than 5 mg%, T-1/2 excretion values at 30, 40, and 50 min were similar to those values calculated using the entire 60 min of data, suggesting that the hepatic phase study time could be reduced to 30-40 min and still use the normal reference values established for 60 min.
 In patients with bilirubin greater than 5 mg%, the data collection duration should be continued for 60 min.
