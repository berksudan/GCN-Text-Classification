The prevalence of gallstone disease in very old institutionalized persons.
 We present the results of a study that was undertaken at a large geriatric nursing home to assess the prevalence of gallstone disease in very old institutionalized persons.
 One hundred seventeen residents underwent ultrasound examination of the gallbladder.
 Two thirds of 82 women and half of 35 men had gallstone disease.
 When stratified for age, 80% of women and men over the age of 90 years were positive for the disease.
 In summary, the prevalence of gallstone disease in our very old nursing home population was found to be unexpectedly high.
