The pharmacist as a health consultant--ten years later.
 Pharmacists remain a readily accessible and trusted source of information about health.
 In order to assess the quality of counseling on health matters and the progress of the profession in this activity over the last decade, a study similar to one reported in 1978 was conducted.
 We visited 46 community pharmacies and requested advice from the pharmacists concerning the proper treatment of an infant with diarrhea.
 Interviewers volunteered no additional information, but questions asked by the pharmacist were answered according to a predetermined hypothetical case involving an 18-month-old infant with diarrhea and vomiting.
 Findings include the following: approximately one-third of the pharmacists recommended a product without caution and less than 20 percent inquired about fever, nausea, vomiting, diet, or the infant's condition.
 We believe pharmacists should approach health counseling with an increased awareness of the harmful potential in providing inappropriate medical information.
