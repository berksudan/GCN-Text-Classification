Sequential esophageal motility studies after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy: a prospective investigation.
 To assess prospectively the effects of endoscopic intravariceal sclerosis (EIS) on esophageal function, we performed esophageal manometry on 13 cirrhotic patients before EIS, 24 h after the second session and 4 wk after the fourth session.
 EIS had no impact on lower esophageal sphincter pressure.
 However, a significant decrease in the amplitude of peristaltic waves was observed immediately post-EIS in the lower two-thirds of the esophagus.
 There was no modification of duration or velocity of progression of peristaltic waves.
 A four-fold increase in simultaneous contractions was observed early after EIS.
 These changes were reversible, as assessed by late esophageal testing after EIS.
 No correlations were demonstrated between esophageal motor parameters and doses of sclerosant.
 We conclude that sclerosant injection into the esophageal wall acutely impairs esophageal motility, but motor function is partially restored 4 wk after completion of EIS, suggesting that dysmotility is reversible.
