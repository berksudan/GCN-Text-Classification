Estrogen receptors in the external anal sphincter.
 Inasmuch as anal competence in women is reduced after the age of 50 years, it may be dependent on effects of estrogens.
 In this study, samples of the external anal sphincter were analyzed for the presence of estrogen receptors and were found to be present at a median concentration of 5.0 fmol per milligram of protein (range, 1.9 to 13) in women (n = 7), and 1.1 fmol per milligram of protein (range, 0 to 3.2) in men (n = 7).
 These findings are of interest with regard to the treatment of idiopathic anal incontinence.
