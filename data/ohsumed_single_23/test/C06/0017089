 Five-year incidence of gallstone disease was assessed by ultrasonography in an age- and sex-stratified random population of Danish origin aged 30, 40, 50, and 60 years.
 The response rate was 82.8% (2987/3608).

 Corresponding figures in women were 1.4%, 3.6%, 3.1%, and 3.7%.
 The incidence of gallstones was significantly higher in subjects aged 45 years or more compared with those aged 35 years.
 The sex difference in gallstone incidence decreased with increasing age.
 A significantly higher incidence of gallstone disease was found among subjects with former polyps in the gallbladder.
 Spontaneous disappearance of gallstones was seen in 4.5%.
