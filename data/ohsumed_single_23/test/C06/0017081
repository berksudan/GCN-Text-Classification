Ascites increases the resting energy expenditure in liver cirrhosis.
 The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ascites on the energy metabolism of patients with liver cirrhosis.
 The resting energy expenditure was determined in 10 patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites of moderate or large volume.
 The resting energy expenditure measurement was performed using indirect calorimetry and the resting energy expenditure predictive value was calculated with the Harris-Benedict equation, both before and after removal of ascitic fluid by paracentesis.
 Metabolic stress factors were absent in all cases.
 After an interval of 11.2 +/- 7.7 days between measurements, a weight loss of 16.6 +/- 10.3 kg was observed with paracentesis.
 The resting energy expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry showed a statistically significant decrease from 1682 +/- 291 to 1523 +/- 240 kcal/day (P less than 0.005) after removal of ascites.
 The repeatability of our indirect calorimetry method only allowed for the analysis of the results in 4 of 10 patients in whom ascites removal produced a consistent decrease in resting energy expenditure.
 There were no statistically significant differences between the measurements obtained by indirect calorimetry and those provided by the Harris-Benedict equation, but the latter had a moderate reliability in predicting the real resting energy expenditure of every patient.
 Our results suggest that, far from being an inert volume, ascites may be associated, at least in some patients, with an increased resting energy expenditure and therefore accelerate the appearance of protein energy malnutrition with corresponding complications.
