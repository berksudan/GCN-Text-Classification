Gastric emptying in infants and children: limited utility of 1-hour measurement.
 Gastric emptying measurements were performed in infants and children at 1 and 2 hours after a liquid feeding.
 The 1-hour measurements were predictive of only 58% of the variability in the 2-hour measurements, indicating that the 1-hour measurement was not a good predictor of the 2-hour measurement.
 Gastric emptying measurements in children should be continued until 2 hours after feeding unless rapid emptying is observed during the 1st hour of the study.
