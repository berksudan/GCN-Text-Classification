Reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient as a consequence of volume contraction due to chronic administration of spironolactone in patients with cirrhosis and no ascites.
 The effect of plasma volume contraction induced by a 4-wk administration of spironolactone or furosemide on the hepatic venous pressure gradient was evaluated in consecutively allocated patients with cirrhosis and no ascites.
 In the spironolactone group (n = 15), the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased significantly (p less than 0.005), by 21.8%, with a significant contraction of circulating plasma volume (p less than 0.01).
 Although there were no statistically significant correlations between the change in hepatic venous pressure gradient and changes in circulating plasma volume or in simultaneously determined systemic hemodynamics, a significant negative correlation (r = -0.74, p less than 0.01, n = 12) between the hepatic venous pressure gradient change and the post-treatment plasma aldosterone levels was found.
 However, in the furosemide group (n = 10), the hepatic venous pressure gradient and circulating plasma volume did not significantly decrease.
 Our data demonstrated a significant reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient on a chronic administration of spironolactone, which may have been due to volume contractions in patients with cirrhosis and no ascites.
