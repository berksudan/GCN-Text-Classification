Reoperation versus alternatives in retained biliary calculi.
 Retained common bile duct stones can be treated by operation, dissolution, extraction, fragmentation, papillotomy, and reoperation.
 Each approach requires some expertise, and the likelihood of success of most depends on the composition and size of the stones.
 Good results often can be obtained nonoperatively, especially with a multidisciplinary team.
 Reoperation is rarely necessary.
