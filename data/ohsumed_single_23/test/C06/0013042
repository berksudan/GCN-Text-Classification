Modified Kraske approach for disease of the mid-rectum.
 A modification of Dr.
 Paul Kraske's approach for removal of mid-rectal lesions has been used in 11 patients from 1977 to 1988 by the senior authors.
 Patients ranged in age from 56 to 89 yr, with an average of 67 yr.
 There were seven male and four female patients.
 Indications for surgery were as follows: villous adenoma (seven), carcinoid (one), recurrent dysplasia in a previous endoscopic polypectomy site (one), positive distal margin for neoplasm following low anterior sigmoid resection (one), and adenocarcinoma in one elderly poor-risk patient.
 All lesions were in the middle rectum (7-11 cm from the anal verge, average 9 cm).
 The postoperative stay ranged from 6 to 12 days with a mean of 8 days.
 The average follow-up for the 11 patients is 3 1/2 yr (1 month to 7 yr), with only one patient having a local recurrent lesion.
 There was no morbidity or mortality.
 We conclude that this modification of the Kraske approach offers a good alternative for excision of mid-rectal lesions in terms of technical ease, efficacy, safety, and patient tolerance.
 The modified Kraske approach is indicated in certain situations and should be a part of the surgeon's armamentarium.
