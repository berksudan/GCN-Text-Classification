Radiographic techniques and efficacy in evaluating esophageal dysphagia.
 The radiographic examination of the esophagus to determine structural and/or functional causes of dysphagia is best performed with multiple techniques.
 These include full-column studies to produce distended films with or without the use of a solid bolus, mucosal relief films to identify mucosal defects such as esophagitis or the presence of varices, double-contrast films, and motion recording (fluoroscopy).
 The efficacy of each technique depends on the quality of the study and the specific disorder to be detected.
 Esophageal lesions producing dysphagia are classified into extrinsic structural lesions, intrinsic structural lesions, and esophageal motility disorders.
 Radiographic studies are the preferred screening techniques for patients with dysphagia.
 Although not as sensitive for the evaluation of mucosal lesions, radiographic studies are superior to endoscopy for the detection of abnormal motility, esophageal rings, and strictures.
