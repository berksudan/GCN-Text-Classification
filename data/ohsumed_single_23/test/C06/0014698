Mechanical sutures in perforation of the thoracic esophagus as a safe procedure in patients seen late.
 Between 1976 and 1988, we treated 13 perforations of the thoracic esophagus, excluding ruptured carcinoma and intraoperative wounds, by mechanical sutures without exclusion.
 The delay between perforation and treatment ranged from eight to 168 hours, more than 24 hours in 11.
 The length of perforation was 0.5 to 15.0 centimeters.
 Suture was covered with a flap in ten instances; an antireflux procedure was associated with five instances.
 No digestive ostomies were performed.
 There was one death; a patient who was comatose upon arrival.
 The results of this small series suggest that myotomy exposing the mucosa and a flap are two essential elements of the technique; perforations of less than 6 centimeters, even when seen late, may be treated by primary surgical closure.
