Long-term follow-up in patients who have undergone balloon dilation for gastric outlet obstruction.
 Although balloon dilation for gastric outlet obstruction has supplanted vagotomy plus drainage or resective therapy in some institutions, there are no long-term data which demonstrate what percentage of patients ultimately requires surgical intervention.
 Of 23 evaluable patients treated with hydrostatic balloon dilation in our institution, 70% were asymptomatic at a mean follow-up of 2.5 years.
 Five patients required surgery--one for acute perforation and the other four for symptoms of continued obstruction, despite one to three additional attempts at dilation.
 Only three of seven patients with previous gastric resection had a satisfactory long-term result.
 Whereas endoscopic therapy initially cost one tenth to one fifth that of surgical intervention, such figures do not factor for loss of productivity, on the one hand, or potential need for chronic H2 blockade, on the other.
 Despite instruction to the contrary, only 6 of 15 (40%) active patients continue acid-suppressive therapy.
 We conclude that balloon dilation remains a viable alternative for selected patients with gastric outlet obstruction.
