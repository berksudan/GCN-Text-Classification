Neuroendocrine design of the gut.
 The enteric nervous system (ENS) can be thought of as the third component of the autonomic nervous system.
 It is a vast network of neurons widely dispersed throughout the gut.
 The ENS is a dominant regulator of gut function through the action of peptide and non-peptide neurotransmitters.
 The most intensively studied roles of the ENS have been the regulation of secretory processes, such as gastric acid secretion, and motility.
 It is clear, however, that the ENS plays a broader role in the regulation of other gut functions, including mucosal defense, the gut immune response, and sphincter function.
 Alterations in the regulation of gut function by the ENS are likely or suspected in a number of conditions, including achalasia, Hirschsprung's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Chagas' disease, chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, biliary dyskinesia, tachygastria, and irritable bowel syndrome.
 Improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of these troublesome conditions makes effective therapy more likely in the future.
