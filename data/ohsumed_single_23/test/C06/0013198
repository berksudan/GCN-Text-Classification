Inguinal hernia complicating flexible sigmoidoscopy.
 Flexible sigmoidoscopy has become part of routine preoperative workup for patients over the age of fifty who present with an inguinal hernia.
 A recent experience with two patients with a left inguinal hernia allowing sigmoid colon to herniate into the scrotum bring awareness of the possibility for an increased risk of perforation of the sigmoid colon during flexible sigmoidoscopy, or possible iatrogenic incarceration of the hernia.
 These cases are presented so this clinical entity can be recognized and the complications prevented.
