Disorders of sexual differentiation and development. Psychological aspects.
 Children with abnormalities in sexual differentiation and development can have a smooth course of psychosocial development in spite of the significant risks and challenges they face.
 Chances for a positive emotional outcome are made more likely by the careful handling of these patients at the time of first presentation.
 Parents' unambiguous acceptance of the child's sex of rearing and early surgical intervention to normalize the child's external genital appearance are critical elements in a positive outcome.
 Further, the patterns of behavior documented in the materials reviewed in this article suggest difficulties of immaturity and social development rather than significant psychopathology.
 Parent-child interactions were repeatedly found to be central to the child's emotional well-being, underscoring the need to provide parents with adequate counsel and support.
 These patterns, however, represent findings across groups of patients and cannot predict the emotional, social, or academic functioning of any individual.
 Within all these clinical syndromes there is great individual variation in social, emotional, and physical presentation.
 Finally, rather than minimizing problems, physicians need to educate parents so they can be active advocates for their children in the educational and social arenas.
