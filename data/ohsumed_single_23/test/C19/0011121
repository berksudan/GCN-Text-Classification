Disparate effects of colchicine on thyroxine-induced cardiac hypertrophy and adrenoceptor changes.
 Short-term (5 days) administration of L-thyroxine (0.1 mg/kg i.p.
 daily) to adult Sprague-Dawley rats induces a modest degree of cardiac hypertrophy (22% increase in heart weight/body weight ratios) and directionally opposite changes in cardiac adrenoceptors (24% increase in beta-adrenoceptors and 20% decline in alpha 1-adrenoceptors).
 Pretreatment with colchicine did not affect the ability of L-thyroxine to induce cardiac hypertrophy but prevented its effects on both beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors.
 These results suggest a selective involvement of microtubules in the action of thyroid hormones on the expression of cardiac adrenoceptor genes.
