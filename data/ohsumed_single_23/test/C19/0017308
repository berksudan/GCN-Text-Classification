Gonadotropin releasing hormones. Clinical applications in gynecology.
 Since the identification and synthesis of gonadotropin releasing hormones (GnRH) 19 years ago, over 2,000 GnRH analogs have been synthesized and evaluated for the treatment of a variety of conditions requiring temporary, reversible suppression or stimulation of gonadotropin secretion.
 Effective stimulation of the gonads requires pulsatile administration of a GnRH agonist, preferably the native decapeptide itself.
 For gonadal suppression, superagonists have proven to be highly effective.
 Intensive studies currently under way promise new and more innovative clinical applications of these compounds.
