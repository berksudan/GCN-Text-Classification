Falsely elevated serum parathyroid hormone levels due to immunoglobulin G in a patient with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism.
 A 73-yr-old patient with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism was admitted to our hospital in May 1981.
 The immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) level determined by RIA using antiserum specific for the C-terminal region of PTH-(65-69) was in the upper normal range (0.6 ng/mL) and over the next 7 yr increased gradually to 6 ng/mL.
 Since iPTH levels determined using other commercial RIA kits remained constantly decreased or in the undetectable range, we studied the mechanism of false elevation of iPTH in this patient.
 The patient's serum contained no binding protein to the tracer ([125I]) [Tyr45] human PTH-(46-84)), nor was any heterophilic antibody to the first [guinea pig immunoglobulin G (IgG)] or the second antibody (goat IgG) detected.
 Consistent with these findings, the dilution curve of the serum was parallel with that of standard bovine PTH-(1-84).
 Gel filtration analysis revealed that the iPTH-like substance was eluted in the void volume (apparent mol wt, greater than 70,000).
 Almost all of the iPTH-like substance was adsorbod by a protein-A-Sepharose column.
 When the IgG fraction purified by protein-A-Sepharose affinity chromatography was applied to an antihuman IgG lambda-Sepharose column, 72% of the iPTH-like substance was detected in the IgG lambda.
 These results suggest that the falsely elevated iPTH in the patient's serum was due to IgGs (mainly IgG lambda), which were cross-reactive with the antiserum highly specific for the C-terminal region of human PTH-(65-69).
