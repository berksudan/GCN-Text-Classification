3 alpha-Androstanediol glucuronide in premature and normal pubarche.
 To investigate the role of adrenal androgens in 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide (3AG) production in childhood, we compared serum 3AG and androgen levels [dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DS), androstenedione (delta 4-A), and testosterone (T)] in 32 children with premature pubarche due to idiopathic premature adrenarche (IPA; n = 26), partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency (n = 2), or 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency (n = 4) with those in 36 normal prepubertal (18 males and 18 females) and 22 normal pubertal Tanner II-III subjects (10 males and 12 females).
 Serum 3AG (2.7 +/- 2.0 nmol/L) and all androgen concentrations in children with IPA were significantly higher (P less than 0.05-0.001) than those in normal prepubertal children (3AG, 0.8 +/- 0.5 nmol/L).
 Serum 3AG and androgen levels, except T, in all children with premature pubarche due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency or 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency were higher than those in the normal prepubertal children.
 Serum 3AG and all androgen levels in normal Tanner II-III male (3AG, 3.8 +/- 1.7 nmol/L) or female (3AG, 1.74 +/- 0.52 nmol/L) subjects were also significantly higher (P less than 0.05-0.001) than those in prepubertal children.
 Serum 3AG, DHEA, DS, and delta 4-A levels in children with IPA were similar to those in normal Tanner II-III females or males, but serum T in children with IPA (0.37 +/- 0.2 nmol/L) was significantly lower (P less than 0.05-0.001) than that in normal pubertal females (0.71 +/- 0.37 nmol/L) or males (4.5 +/- 2.6 nmol/L).
 In the combined group (n = 88), 3AG levels correlated better with serum DS (r = 0.7), DHEA (r = 0.6), and delta 4-A (r = 0.52), than with T (r = 0.31) levels.
 These data suggest that the weak adrenal androgens DS, DHEA, and delta 4-A contribute substantially to 3AG production in premature and normal pubarche.
