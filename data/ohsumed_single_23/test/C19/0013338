Thyroid hormones and 5'-deiodinase in the rat fetus late in gestation: effects of maternal hypothyroidism.
 Having previously observed that T4 and T3 levels in fetal rat brain and brown adipose tissue are clearly higher than expected from their low circulating levels, we have now studied thyroid hormone concentrations and 5'-deiodinase activities (5'D) in several other rat fetal tissues during the last 6 days of gestation (dg), namely 17-22 dg.
 This period comprises the onset of fetal thyroid activity.
 Total thyroidal T4 and T3 contents increased 100- and 400-fold, respectively; T4 concentrations increased 8- to 10-fold in plasma, carcass, lung, and liver, and T3 increased 4.5- to 9-fold, except in plasma and liver, where T3 levels increased less than 2-fold in plasma and 3-fold in liver.
 During this developmental period 5'D activity increased 5- and 10-fold in fetal liver and lung, respectively.
 In fetuses from hypothyroid [thyroidectomized (T)] dams, body weight was lower than in fetuses from normal dams.
 Total thyroidal T4 and T3 contents were initially the same, but decreased markedly in fetuses from T dams by the end of gestation.
 At the earliest fetal ages studied (17-18 dg) T4 and T3 concentrations were lower in carcass, liver, lung, and brain, although near term there were no consistent differences between the fetal tissues from T and control dams, probably because of compensatory stimulation of thyroidal secretion.
 Liver 5'D was decreased by 50% throughout gestation, and lung 5'D activities were lower by the end of gestation.
 Thyroid hormones in placentas from T dams were very low, but increased by the end of gestation because of the contribution by the fetal thyroid.
 Present results describe the ontogenic profiles for thyroid hormone concentrations and 5'D activities during late fetal development; active regulatory mechanisms are already present at this age.
 It has been frequently stated that rat fetuses near term are deficient in thyroid hormones, and that their thyroid hormone economy is independent of maternal thyroid status, but present results show that near term, T4 and T3 concentrations in several tissues reach levels that are 50% or more of those described for adult animals, and that fetal thyroid function is influenced by maternal hypothyroidism.
