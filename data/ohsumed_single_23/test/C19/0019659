Premixed insulins. How do they compare with other insulin preparations?
 With the availability of premixed insulins, physicians and diabetic patients have a wider choice of therapeutic options.
 The premixed preparation now available in the United States consists of 70% NPH insulin and 30% regular insulin.
 The major advantages of premixed insulins are convenience and improved accuracy.
 They are suitable for patients who are too impaired to mix their own insulin dose and for those whose mixed-dose ratio is similar to that of the 70/30 preparation.
