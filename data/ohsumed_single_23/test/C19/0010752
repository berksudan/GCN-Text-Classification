The Cushing syndromes.
 The 10 years since this journal's last review of CS have seen extraordinary advances in our understanding of many aspects of its causes, diagnosis, and treatment.
 The spectrum of what are now called the Cushing syndromes has expanded considerably to include CD, multiple sources of ectopic ACTH secretion, and an apparent autoimmune cause.
 Improved assays of ACTH and the availability of CRF have provided new insight into the physiology and pathophysiology of the HPA axis and new tools for diagnosis of CS, especially in combination with selective catheterization and sampling.
 New imaging technology has improved our visualization of pituitary adenomas and has provided powerful methods for identifying tumors ectopically secreting ACTH and primary adrenal tumors.
 Finally, the refinement of transsphenoidal surgery and its success in treating CD have provided a safe and effective therapy for this disease.
 For those occasional patients who require medical therapy, drugs are available that decrease steroid biosynthesis.
 We now have a much better understanding of a fascinating disease process and are able to diagnose and treat it more correctly.
 One is impatient to see which new pieces of this puzzle will fall into place over the next ten years.
