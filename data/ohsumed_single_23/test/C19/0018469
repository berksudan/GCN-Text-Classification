Diabetes care in a rural primary health care district where patient education is given high priority. Metabolic evaluation.
 The present population-based study comprises 84% of all known diabetics cared for at a rural primary health care centre.
 Patient education has been given high priority as an integral part of the treatment provided by a specially trained nurse and dietician under the supervision of the general practitioners.
 Most of the patients were under good metabolic control, as reflected by HbA1 (diet-treated, n = 119, 7.3 +/- 1.3%; oral agent-treated, n = 127, 7.8% +/- 1.3%; insulin-treated, n = 110, 8.0 +/- 1.3%; reference range 5.3-7.3%).
 Obvious reasons for any high HbA1 values were found.
