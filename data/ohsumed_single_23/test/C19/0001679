Fructosamine compared with a glucose load as a screening test for gestational diabetes.
 Five hundred seven women were screened for gestational diabetes between 20-36 weeks' gestation.
 All received a 100-g glucose (polycose) load at 28 weeks with measurement of plasma glucose 1 hour later.
 Fructosamine levels were measured at 4-week intervals from 20-36 weeks.
 At 36 weeks, a full 100-g 3-hour glucose tolerance test was performed on all subjects.
 Eighteen women were diagnosed as having gestational diabetes.
 The glucose load had a sensitivity of 81% in detection of gestational diabetes, compared with 50% for fructosamine at 36 weeks.
 Fructosamine is not useful as a screening test for gestational diabetes as currently defined.
