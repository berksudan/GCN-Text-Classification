Primary and secondary testicular insufficiency.
 The possibility of testicular insufficiency is a common problem for the pediatric practitioner.
 Presentation varies with the severity of the defect, the developmental age achieved before onset, and the presence of associated other abnormalities.
 Most commonly, primary and secondary testicular insufficiency present at the time of puberty, but the presentation may be at birth or in the early neonatal period.
 Appropriate investigations may uncover the diagnosis at the time and allow intervention later at the appropriate age.
 Secondary testicular failure, although more difficult to diagnose and to differentiate from simple delay of development, offers the possibility of later development of spermatogenesis and the attainment of fertility through the use of gonadotropins or GnRH replacement programs.
 In primary testicular failure, because it implies an intrinsic abnormality of the functioning elements of the testis, spermatogenesis is not inducable by hormonal stimulation.
 Treatment of testicular failure in the neonatal period is unnecessary unless micropenis is associated.
 In the pubertal boy, testosterone replacement is the treatment of choice and should be initiated carefully, taking into consideration the age of the subject, his bone age, and the psychosocial circumstances.
 The goal of therapy is to achieve a normal progression of physical changes of puberty to physical maturity and the normal potential for sexual function.
