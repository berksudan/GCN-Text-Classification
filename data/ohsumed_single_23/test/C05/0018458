A method of assessment of the clubfoot deformity.
 The literature on clubfeet is inadequate because a common method language for assessing the deformity is lacking.
 Different severities of clubfoot deformity will give different results for a standard procedure: a less severe deformity can be corrected by limited releases, whereas a severe deformity requires radical procedures.
 This paper presents a language of assessment that has been used for a number of years.
 The importance of developing a language of assessment to be able to identify the various types of clubfoot deformity is important if the treatment of this condition is to develop within the field of pediatric orthopedics.
