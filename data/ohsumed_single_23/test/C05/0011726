Clinical evaluation of the ITI (F-type) hollow cylinder implant.
 In 1976 the hollow cylinder implant was introduced.
 A number of articles have been published about the ITI implant system.
 In this article, short-term results of 102 ITI F-type implants in 40 patients are reported.
 The results showed this one-stage implant to be at least comparable to other well-known implant systems.
