Peripheral giant cell granuloma: evidence for osteoclastic differentiation.
 Nine cases of peripheral giant cell granuloma of the oral cavity have been immunohistochemically analyzed to assess the nature of the giant cells.
 Giant cells were unreactive when tested with antibodies recognizing myelomonocytic and macrophage markers (lysozyme, MAC 387, HAM 56) but showed strong immunoreactivity with MB1, an antibody reactive with osteoclasts.
 It is concluded that giant cells characterizing giant cell granuloma exhibit a phenotype distinct from other giant cells found in sites of chronic inflammation and may be true osteoclasts.
