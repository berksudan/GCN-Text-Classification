Correlation between serum osteocalcin and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels in Paget's disease of bone.
 We have studied the possible correlation between serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25-(OH)2D] and osteocalcin levels (sBGP) in Paget's disease of bone.
 We measured serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-(OH)2D, 24,25-(OH)2D, alkaline phosphatase (sAP), and the urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio (UOH prol/creat) in 19 patients with Paget's disease of bone and 16 age- and sex-matched controls.
 As expected, sAP, UOH prol/creat, and sBGP levels were significantly elevated, and there was a tendency to a decrease in serum levels of 24,25-(OH)2D in Pagetic patients with respect to the control group.
 There was no significant difference between patients and controls in serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25-(OH)2D.
 The Pagetic patients were subdivided into two subgroups; subgroup A had normal sBGP levels (less than 5 ng/mL), and subgroup B had increased sBGP levels (greater than 5 ng/mL).
 Serum 24,25-(OH)2D levels in subgroup B were significantly lower than those in controls, while subgroup A showed levels similar to those in the control group.
 We also found a positive linear correlation between sAP and sBGP and between sAP and UOH prol/creat as well as a negative linear correlation between sBGP and 24,25-(OH)2D and between 24,25-(OH)2D and UOH prol/creat in Pagetic patients.
 These results point to a possible role of 24,25-(OH)2D in disease activity.
