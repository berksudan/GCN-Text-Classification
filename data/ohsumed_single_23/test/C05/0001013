Surgical approaches in osteomyelitis. Use of laser Doppler flowmetry to determine nonviable bone.
 The surgical management of osteomyelitis includes radical debridement on nonviable bone.
 Laser Doppler flowmetry is a method for directly assessing the functional microcirculation in bone.
 The early results of the use of this technique as a surgical adjunct in the management of osteomyelitis are promising.
