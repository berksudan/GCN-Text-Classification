Osteoporosis.
 Osteoporosis, a condition of decreased bone tissue that increases the likelihood of fracture, places a significant burden on our society in terms of health cost and morbidity.
 The most common type of osteoporosis is involutional, and two subtypes are recognized: type 1 and type 2.
 Type 1, or postmenopausal, osteoporosis is most commonly seen in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women from ages 51 to 75.
 Estrogen deficiency is the most dominant factor in the pathogenesis of this disorder.
 Type 2, or aging related, osteoporosis is seen in elderly women and men aged 70 or more.
 Bone loss in this group is related to aging, estrogen deficiency, negative calcium balance, and a variety of environmental and genetic factors.
 The best approach to the management of osteoporosis is to develop a lifelong strategy that maximizes peak bone mass and minimizes aging-related and postmenopausal bone loss.
 Estrogen is the only medication approved for the prevention of bone loss that is in general use.
 Other strategies to prevent bone loss (and maximize peak bone mass) include adequate calcium intake, adequate exercise, and avoidance of excess alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine use.
