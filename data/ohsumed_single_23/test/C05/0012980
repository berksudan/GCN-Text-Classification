Long-term results of anterior interbody fusion for treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis.
 Thirty-nine patients, 34 women and five men, underwent anterior decompression and interbody fusion for degenerative spondylolisthesis between February 1958 and August 1988.
 Their average age at surgery was 51 years (range, 34-74 years), and their average follow-up period was 12 years 7 months (range, 6 months to 30 years).
 Clinical evaluation was done by the score rating system of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA Score).
 Patients with JOA scores of 25 points or more were rated as "satisfactory." Survivorship was analyzed by the method of Kaplan and Meier to determine the cumulative percentage of patients with satisfactory results.
 The following results were obtained: Seventy-six percent of the patients had satisfactory results for 10 years after the anterior interbody fusion, 60% for 20 years, and 52% for 30 years.
 Irrespective of their age at surgery, the patients generally maintained satisfactory results up to 65 years of age.
