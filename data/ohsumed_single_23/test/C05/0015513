Histopathology of metastatic temporal bone tumors.
 Temporal bone metastasis is now being reported with increasing frequency.
 To understand the process of temporal bone metastasis, complete histologic evaluation of the temporal bones is essential.
 In this study, 60 temporal bones from 33 patients were evaluated.
 Different patterns of temporal bone involvement were noted depending on the mode of spread to the temporal bone.
 Involvement of the temporal bone usually occurs late in the disease process and is often asymptomatic.
