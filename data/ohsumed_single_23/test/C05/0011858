Osteoporosis. Current techniques and recent developments in quantitative bone densitometry.
 Knowledge about the proper use and interpretation of bone densitometry studies and an understanding of appropriate medical interventions are not universal among physicians, nor are instrumentation and technical performance of bone density studies of uniformly high quality.
 Indeed, this deficiency of medical and technical expertise is the principal deterrent to widespread implementation of our recommended clinical applications at this time.
 Nonetheless, given the current impetus to disseminate information about osteoporosis, to make newer instrumentation more readily available, and to limit the cost of these techniques, we anticipate that our recommendations may soon become standard medical practice.
