Growth promoting peptides in osteoarthritis: insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone.
 Alterations of cartilage and bone, as seen radiographically, are fundamental features of osteoarthritis (OA).
 Endogenous compounds that regulate bone and cartilage metabolism were quantified by radioimmunoassay in patients with OA and in suitable normotensive controls matched for age, sex, race, height, and weight.
 Levels of 3 growth promoting compounds were abnormal in OA as demonstrated by low levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and elevated levels of insulin and growth hormone (GH) compared to controls.
 Our findings support a role for these peptides in the pathophysiology of OA.
