Bone trabecular pattern analysis in Down syndrome with the use of computed panoramic radiography. Part II: Visual pattern analysis with the frequency and gradational enhancement.
 Visual pattern analysis of mandibular bone trabeculation of 51 patients with Down syndrome and 78 normal persons was performed by using rotational panoramic radiography with a laser scan system.
 The findings for patients with Down syndrome were consistent with geromorphism, one of the somatic characteristics of Down syndrome.
