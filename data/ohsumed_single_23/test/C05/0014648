Trigger finger secondary to anomalous lumbrical insertion: a case report and review of the literature.
 Trigger finger is a relatively common clinical entity, most frequently caused by stenosing tenosynovitis.
 Several other conditions not related to tenosynovitis also have been described as a cause of triggering, and these have been reviewed.
 We present a rare anomaly of the fourth lumbrical muscle insertion as a cause of triggering of the right little finger.
 This was completely relieved following excision of the anomalous muscle.
 This rare anatomic variant should be added to the list of potential causes of trigger finger.
