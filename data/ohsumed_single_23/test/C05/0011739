African Burkitt's lymphoma: case report and light and electron microscopic findings.
 An African Burkitt's lymphoma occurred in a 9-year-old American boy who had jaw tumors, proptosis, and abdominal masses.
 Histologically, the tumor consisted of a monotonous overgrowth of undifferentiated lymphocytes with a "starry sky" appearance.
 The differential diagnosis of African versus American form and Burkitt's lymphoma versus non-Burkitt's lymphoma is discussed.
