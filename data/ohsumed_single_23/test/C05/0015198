Drugs to lower uric acid levels. How to avoid misuse in gouty arthritis.
 Several points regarding the use of drugs to lower uric acid levels deserve emphasis.
 First, these agents are not useful in the management of acute gout.
 Second, all forms of the drugs should be initiated at low dose with gradual increments to achieve a serum uric acid level between 5 and 6 mg/dL.
 There are no data to support the widely presumed notion that dropping the uric acid level to a very low range (1 to 3 mg/dL) hastens resorption of tophi or improves joint function.
 Third, the uricosuric agents probenecid (Benemid) and sulfinpyrazone (Anturane) interact with a number of drugs, and both the patient and physician should be aware of this.
 Finally, and most important, careful and frequent monitoring is needed during the first several months of therapy with these drugs.
