The operative management of basilar impression in osteogenesis imperfecta.
 Four patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and neurologically significant basilar impression have been treated over the past 8 years.
 The experience has resulted in changes in our therapeutic strategy for this particularly difficult problem.
 These cases are discussed with respect to the disease process, neurological involvement, radiological findings, and modes of surgical therapy.
 The errors in management as well as the success resulting from our learning experience are described.
 Currently, we recommend the extensive removal of the anterior bony compression by a transoral approach.
 This should be followed by a posterior rigid fixation that transfers the weight of the head to the thoracic spine, in an effort to prevent further basilar invagination.
