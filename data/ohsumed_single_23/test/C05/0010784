Surface electrical stimulation versus brace in treatment of idiopathic scoliosis.
 Surface electrical stimulation using the ScoliTron device was applied to 40 adolescent patients for treatment of idiopathic scoliosis.
 Adequate follow-up was available for 30 of these patients.
 The overall failure rate was 15 of 30 or 50%.
 Due to curve progression while using the ScoliTron, these patients either went on to a fusion (9 of 15) or were changed to a brace (6 of 15).
 The remaining 15 patients were considered successes with no curve progression (10 of 30 or 33%) or successful/failures with slight curve progression not requiring a change in treatment (5 of 30 or 17%).
 None of the various parameters analyzed were found to be useful indicators of successful treatment using the ScoliTron device.
 Electrical stimulation was found to be ineffective in preventing curve progression for idiopathic scoliosis.
