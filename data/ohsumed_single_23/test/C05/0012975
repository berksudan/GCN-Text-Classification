The system and procedures of percutaneous intradiscal laser nucleotomy.
 Since 1986, percutaneous intradiscal laser nucleotomy (PILN) has been studied in the authors' laser laboratory.
 The purpose of this report is to develop PILN as an alternative to chemonucleolysis and percutaneous discectomy, which are currently applied, and to establish a safe, easy, accurate and short-time therapy method for lumbar disc herniation.
 After laser irradiation, intradiscal pressures (IDP) decreased and the nucleus pulposus was gradually replaced with cartilaginous fibrous tissue.
 The evaluation of heat distribution with thermocouples and thermography was done to determine safe optimum irradiating conditions and to develop a new double-lumen needle and a bare quartz fiber.
 Neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd-YAG) laser devices have been improved for easy and safe use, and a new tip type pressure transducer has been made for improved therapeutic results using this new method.
