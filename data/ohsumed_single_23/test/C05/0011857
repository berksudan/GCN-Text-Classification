Radiographic appearance of osteopenia.
 The radiographic appearance of bone is the result of two physiologic processes: the resorption of bone and the remodeling of bone in response to the stresses applied to it.
 The relative rates of these two processes will determine the structural and, therefore, the radiographic appearance of the affected bone.
