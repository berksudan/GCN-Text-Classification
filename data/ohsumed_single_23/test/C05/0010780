Microcomputer reconstruction for analysis of spinal deformity and lung volume in hypokyphotic scoliosis.
 Current techniques for imaging chest deformity are limited to two-dimensional representations, and clinical testing for lung volume measurements are based on pulmonary function studies that are effort-dependent.
 The authors evaluated spine deformity and lung volume by using a new three-dimensional microcomputer imaging technique.
 Results from preoperative and postoperative chest computed tomograms underwent boundary detection by expert human observers.
 Data were then processed by polygon surface tiling to create three-dimensional color images of the spine and lungs for display.
 This computer technique allowed: 1) visualization of the anatomic relationships from any angle, 2) assessment of spinal deformity in relation to lung volume, and 3) measurement of individual lung volumes.
 Three-dimensional microcomputer imaging is a useful technique in objectively measuring lung volume and assessing postoperative changes.
