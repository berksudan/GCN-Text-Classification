Massive osteolysis of the maxillofacial bones. Report of two cases.
 Two cases of massive osteolysis were encountered, one affecting the mandible and the other the maxilla and mandible.
 Only 13 cases have been reported so far in the existing literature for massive osteolysis of the mandible.
 It is indeed a rare disease.
 Our two cases were surgically treated and were clinically and histopathologically assessed.
