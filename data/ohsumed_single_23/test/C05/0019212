Cyclosporin-A in vitro decreases bone resorption, osteoclast formation, and the fusion of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage.
 We studied the in vitro effect of cyclosporin-A (CyA) on bone resorption using a fetal rat long bone-resorbing assay.
 CyA inhibited both PTH-stimulated and unstimulated bone resorption.
 The inhibitory effect of CyA on basal resorption was dose dependent, and it was more pronounced during the second period (less than or equal to 0.1 microgram/ml) of culture (days 5-7) than during the first period (days 2-4).
 A cytotoxic effect was ruled out by the absence of decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation into bones up to a concentration of 5 micrograms/ml CyA.
 Histomorphometry performed after 4 and 7 days of culture showed that CyA (1 microgram/ml) decreased the number of osteoclasts per bone section after 7 days of culture (23.5 +/- 4.0 vs.
 41.7 +/- 2.9 osteoclasts/bone section; P less than 0.05), but not after 4 days (25.6 +/- 3.3 vs.
 23.0 +/- 2.5).
 These data suggested an effect of CyA on osteoclastic differentiation rather than on the function of mature osteoclasts.
 We further assessed the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of CyA on osteoclastic differentiation in order to determine 1) the level of this action (proliferation and/or fusion of osteoclast precursors), and 2) if this action is direct or indirect.
 Autoradiographic studies were performed on bone sections after incubation of bones with [3H]thymidine for the last 48 h of culture.
 CyA decreased slightly but significantly the percentage of labeled nuclei per osteoclast and the number of osteoclasts containing at least one labeled nucleus (20.2 +/- 0.7 vs.
 33.2 +/- 3.5; P less than 0.02).
 Moreover the number of nuclei per osteoclast was decreased after 7 days in CyA-treated bones (2.4 +/- 0.05 vs.
 3.0 +/- 0.1; P less than 0.02).
 Taken together these results demonstrate that CyA slightly decreased the proliferation of osteoclast precursors, but markedly decreased their fusion.
 Similar effects were observed in cultures of rat marrow macrophages.
 CyA (1 microgram/ml) inhibited the fusion of macrophages into multinucleated cells elicited by 1 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, but had only a slight effect on the proliferation of these cells, as assessed by autoradiography.
 CyA also inhibited the formation of multinucleated cells and the fusion index in long term cultures of human cord blood monocytes, a cellular model for osteoclastic differentiation.
 By contrast, CyA had no effect on the formation of myotubes by fusion of cultured mononucleated rat myoblasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).
