Application technique of Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation for scoliosis deformities.
 Used in over 600 cases, the posterior Cotrel-Dubousset spinal instrumentation device has become the device of choice.
 This technique allows the most effective correction for all kinds of spinal deformities.
 It requires lengthy preoperative planning and is a technically demanding surgical procedure; however, because of its versatility it can be adapted to most spinal deformities.
 The Cotrel- Dubousset technique is a rigid system of immobilization, and, because it does not require any postoperative immobilization, patients are able to resume their normal lives and activities very quickly.
