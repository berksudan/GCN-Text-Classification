Magnetic resonance imaging appearance of the muscles in childhood dermatomyositis.
 Documentation of muscle involvement in a child thought to have dermatomyositis may require the performance of invasive procedures such as electromyography and/or muscle biopsy.
 We describe four patients with dermatomyositis in whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the muscle involvement.
 The involved muscles had increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images (SE 2500/80) and normal appearance on the T1-weighted images (SE 600/20).
 The involvement of the muscles was not uniform.
 There was good correlation between the distribution of muscle involvement by MRI and functional testing.
 Follow-up MRI scans in patients with favorable outcome demonstrated that the affected muscles had returned to normal signal intensity.
 Although the MRI findings are not specific, in the proper clinical context they may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of dermatomyositis.
 MRI may also be used in establishing an appropriate muscle biopsy site.
 In addition, MRI may be used for monitoring the progress of the disease.
