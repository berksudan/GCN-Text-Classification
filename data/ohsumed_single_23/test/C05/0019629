Nursing management of the adolescent with idiopathic scoliosis.
 Management of the adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patient has many intricate considerations.
 Whether the patient is braced or surgery is recommended, there is a lot of teaching, assessing, and compassion when dealing with adolescents whose biggest concern is being like their peers.
 It is important to allow as much independence in decision making as possible, whether it be about bracing or surgical intervention, as long as they clearly understand the consequences.
 Newer, better surgical instruments, anesthesia, nursing care, and postoperative mobility all have changed the management of the operative scoliosis patient significantly.
 Nursing assessment of neurologic, respiratory, function, emotional, and developmental needs of the adolescent patient, however, have not changed.
 If we, as nurses, understand the rationale for assessments, treatments, and restrictions, we can teach our patients and their families.
