Chronic fatigue syndrome: is it real?
 Epstein-Barr virus is no longer considered an important cause of chronic fatigue syndrome.
 Instead, the disease is probably related to an underlying psychiatric disorder, subtle immunologic dysfunction, or an interaction between these two factors.
 A carefully taken history, physical examination, and simple laboratory testing are usually sufficient to establish the diagnosis.
 Therapy with antidepressants or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be effective in selected patients.
 Thorough follow-up conducted with empathy and optimism is important in all cases.
