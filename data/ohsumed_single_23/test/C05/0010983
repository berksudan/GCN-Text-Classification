Suppression of type II collagen-induced arthritis by monoclonal antibodies.
 Some mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against chicken type II collagen suppressed or delayed the onset of chicken type II collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1 mice.
 This was correlated with the suppression of anti-mouse type II collagen antibody responses following immunization with chicken type II collagen.
 The epitopes recognized by the suppressive antibodies were found to be present on cyanogen bromide (CB)-digested collagen peptides CB-11 and CB-12.
 This was also confirmed by the finding that administration of the CB-11 or CB-12 peptide suppressed the induction of arthritis.
