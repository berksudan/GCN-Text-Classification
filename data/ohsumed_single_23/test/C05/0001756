Silicone rubber fossa implant removal via partial arthrotomy followed by arthroscopic examination of the internal surface of the fibrous capsule.
 Thirteen temporomandibular joints were examined arthroscopically for evaluation for fibrous encapsulation of silicone elastomer disk replacement implants.
 Partial arthrotomies were performed with removal of silicone rubber implants, followed by arthroscopic examination of the internal surfaces of the fibrous capsule as a pseudodisk and to verify the continuity of the fibrous barrier between the condyle and the fossa.
