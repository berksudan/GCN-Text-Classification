In vivo muscle magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the clinical investigation of mitochondrial disease.
 We have investigated the sensitivity and specificity of a rapid phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocol for detecting metabolic abnormalities in vivo in skeletal muscle of patients with mitochondrial disease.
 We examined 17 patients with mitochondrial myopathies.
 Sixteen had only mild or minimal myopathic signs and symptoms.
 Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectra from the resting gastrocnemius muscles showed an abnormal intracellular energy state (marked by an increased intracellular inorganic phosphate concentration) in 14/17.
 In 3/17, this was associated with a decreased phosphocreatine concentration.
 We also studied 20 patients with other diseases of muscle (inflammatory myopathies, metabolic myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and myasthenia gravis) that can present with similar clinical features.
 Spectra showed increased intracellular inorganic phosphate concentrations in 6/20.
 All of these muscle diseases were associated with evidence of muscle fiber necrosis.
 Abnormalities in the muscle energy state in these cases may be due to secondary mitochondrial dysfunction.
 Except for cases of polymyositis and dermatomyositis, these 6 other myopathies could be readily distinguished from the mitochondrial myopathies on the basis of the clinical examination and blood tests.
 We conclude that phosphorus MRS of resting muscle is practical in a clinical setting and has a useful sensitivity and specificity for mitochondrial myopathies when used in conjunction with standard noninvasive tests.
