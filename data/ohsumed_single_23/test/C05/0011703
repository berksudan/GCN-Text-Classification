Centronuclear myopathy heterogeneity: distinction of clinical types by myosin isoform patterns.
 We studied muscles from 3 patients with centronuclear myopathy (CNM) by immunocytochemistry using myosin heavy chain (MHC)-specific monoclonal antibodies to determine whether subtypes of CNM express prenatal MHC and to assess if there is an arrest in development of these muscles.
 Muscle from a woman with childhood-onset CNM did not express prenatal MHC, yet this prenatal MHC was strongly expressed in the muscle fibers of 2 brothers with X-linked CNM.
 This finding represents the 1st immunocytochemical evidence of the expression of a prenatal myosin isoform in nonregenerating postnatal human muscle and suggests that the X-linked form of CNM differs from the other types because of a true arrest in maturation of the muscle.
