Musculoskeletal infection, microbial adhesion, and antibiotic resistance.
 Osteomyelitis and intra-articular infection are septic diseases that present pathogenic features characteristic of molecular mechanisms involving adhesion to substrata.
 In this review, mechanisms of microbial adhesion to bone and cartilage as substrata are presented and related to host tissue response and to antibiotic treatment.
