A protocol for management of temporomandibular joint ankylosis.
 A management protocol for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis consisting of 1) aggressive resection, 2) ipsilateral coronoidectomy, 3) contralateral coronoidectomy when necessary, 4) lining of the TMJ with temporalis fascia or cartilage, 5) reconstruction of the ramus with a costochondral graft, 6) rigid fixation, and 7) early mobilization and aggressive physiotherapy is presented.
 The protocol was retrospectively evaluated in the first 14 patients (18 involved TMJs) treated and followed postoperatively for at least 1 year.
 The facial asymmetries present in all unilateral cases remained corrected.
 The mean maximum postoperative interincisal opening at 1 year was 37.5 mm (292.36% mean increase), lateral excursions were present in 16 of 18 joints (vs 0 of 18 joints preoperatively), and pain was present in 2 of 18 joints (vs 13 of 18 preoperatively).
 The results of this study indicate that this protocol is effective for treatment of TMJ ankylosis.
