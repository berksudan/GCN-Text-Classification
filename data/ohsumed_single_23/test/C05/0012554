Effect of a single infusion of aminohydroxypropylidene on calcium and bone metabolism in healthy volunteers monitored during 2 months.
 Recently, bisphosphonates have been used to prevent postmenopausal bone loss.
 As the effects of bisphosphonates on normal bone metabolism are unknown, 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-diphosphonate (APD) was studied in healthy subjects.
 The effects of a single 20-mg APD infusion on biochemical parameters of calcium and bone metabolism were investigated during 2 months in 10 healthy male volunteers.
 This single moderate dose of APD reduced biochemical parameters of bone resorption during the time of follow-up.
 After 2 months, urinary hydroxyproline excretion was still below the basal level.
 The decreased serum calcium levels did not return to basal values.
 Biochemical parameters of bone formation, serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, showed a slight increase during the first month after stimulation of the parathyroids and a corresponding increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
 These formation parameters decreased thereafter, probably representing coupling between bone resorption and bone formation.
