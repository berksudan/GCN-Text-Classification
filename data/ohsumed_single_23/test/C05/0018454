Histochemical localization of calcium with potassium pyroantimonate in the articular tissues in calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease.
 The ultrastructural localization of calcium in the articular cartilage, meniscus, and synovium of patients with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease was examined by using potassium pyroantimonate.
 Focal areas with deposition of CPPD crystals in each tissue showed electron-dense precipitates of the antimony-calcium complex: (1) in the cytoplasm of hypertrophic chondrocytes around CPPD crystals, especially on the margins of intracellular lipid droplets or within electron-dense amorphous material or both; and (2) on the margins of lipid droplets and within electron-dense amorphous material in the degenerated matrix surrounding the hypertrophic chondrocytes.
 The slender rodlike structures consisting of electron-dense precipitates of the antimony-calcium complex, suggestive of the precursor to rodlike CPPD crystals, were also observed in the degenerated matrix.
 These findings suggest that the hypertrophic chondrocytes may contribute to the formation of CPPD crystals by intracellular accumulation of calcium and subsequent release of high concentration of calcium into their surrounding matrix.
