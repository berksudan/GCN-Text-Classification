Internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint: a histochemical study.
 The purpose of this study was to correlate histologic findings in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condyles and discs with their macroscopic appearance at surgery.
 The 24 patients with internal derangement of the joint included 20 women and 4 men (mean age, 37 years; range, 18 to 61 years).
 The tissue lesions varied in degree from mild soft-tissue fraying and bone remodeling to extensive resorption and new cartilage and bone formation with high phosphatase enzyme activities, and even to loss of articular soft tissue and breakdown of cortical bone.
 Reactions may arise in the hard tissues before they occur in the articular surface layers.
