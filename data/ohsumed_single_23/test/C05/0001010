Diagnostic imaging of osteomyelitis.
 There are many imaging procedures for diagnosing osteomyelitis, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.
 Plain radiographs are inexpensive and can be very accurate but may provide a delayed diagnosis.
 Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are both excellent at differentiating soft tissue infection from osteomyelitis.
 Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and bone scans are accurate diagnostic tools for use when the bone has not be violated by surgery, trauma, or other structural alterations.
 When such changes are present, an Indium-111 leukocyte or Indium-111 polyclonal antibody study may be necessary for accurate diagnosis.
