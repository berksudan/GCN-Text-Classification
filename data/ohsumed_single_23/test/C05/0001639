Effect of estrone sulfate on postmenopausal bone loss.
 Estrogen replacement therapy confers many beneficial effects to postmenopausal women, such as slowing the rate of bone loss and decreasing the risk of coronary artery disease.
 This multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluated the lowest effective daily dose of estrone sulfate (0.3, 0.625, or 1.25 mg) combined with 1000 mg elemental calcium supplementation for preventing bone loss in the immediate supplementation for preventing bone loss in the immediate postmenopausal period.
 Spinal bone mineral density was measured using quantitative computed tomography.
 Compared with baseline, bone mineral density increased significantly (P less than .05) after 12 months of 0.625 mg daily (+ 1.9%) or 1.25 mg daily (+ 2.5%).
 The difference between the 0.625-mg and 1.25-mg doses was not statistically significant.
 Estrone sulfate administration (0.625 and 1.25 mg) produced significant changes in various lipid measurements at both the 6- and 12-month observation points.
 The prevalence rates for adverse events were comparable among the estrone sulfate groups and the placebo group.
 Estrone sulfate 0.625 mg daily, combined with 1000 mg elemental calcium supplementation, was the minimum effective dosage to prevent loss of spinal bone mineral density in postmenopausal women over a 12-month period.
