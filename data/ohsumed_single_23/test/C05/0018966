Quantitative gait analysis in unilateral and bilateral total hip replacements.
 By qualitative and quantitative analysis of gait we evaluated the outcomes in 41 patients after total hip arthroplasty for degenerative arthritis.
 Patients with unilateral and bilateral degenerative hip disease were evaluated in an effort to characterize preoperative and postoperative gait characteristics.
 Patients were evaluated using a subjective hip-rating scale and a gait-evaluation mat.
 Data were compared with those obtained from a control group of 91 patients.
 All patients showed a marked improvement in both subjective ratings and measured quantitative gait parameters.
 Patients with unilateral hip disease improved to a greater extent than those with bilateral disease after arthroplasty.
 We have concluded that total hip arthroplasty can greatly improve the gait characteristics of patients with degenerative arthritis, and that this improvement can be quantified, documented, and followed by using a system of gait evaluation.
