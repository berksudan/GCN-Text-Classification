Correction of coxa vara in childhood. The use of Pauwels' Y-shaped osteotomy.
 The long-term results following the correction of coxa vara by Pauwels' Y-shaped intertrochanteric osteotomy have been evaluated in 14 children.
 Ten of the children had unilateral hip disease and were otherwise normal while four had bilateral hip disease due to generalised skeletal dysplasias.
 In each case, the growth plate was vertical, the femoral head was displaced inferiorly and there were abnormalities in the metaphysis of the femoral neck.
 The results indicate that this osteotomy provides lasting correction of the deformity, regardless of the cause, as long as the inclination of the growth plate is corrected to 40 degrees or less and adequate support is provided for the metaphyseal defect and the displaced femoral head.
