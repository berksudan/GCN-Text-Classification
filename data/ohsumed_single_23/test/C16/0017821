Changes in left ventricular diastolic filling patterns by Doppler echocardiography in cystic fibrosis.
 The onset of cor pulmonale is a common terminal finding in patients with cystic fibrosis.
 Since Doppler echocardiography can detect changes in diastolic filling patterns prior to the onset of either systolic dysfunction or clinical symptoms, we utilized this technique to determine whether detectable changes in left ventricular diastolic filling patterns exist in patients with cystic fibrosis.
 Among 25 patients, the proportion of left ventricular filling attributable to atrial contraction was significantly increased when compared with age-matched control individuals.
 When filling patterns were compared with severity of pulmonary disease, worsening pulmonary disease was directly correlated to shifts in left ventricular filling patterns.
 We conclude that changes in left ventricular patterns of relaxation are detectable early in the course of cystic fibrosis and that such changes are probably progressive.
 Early detection could lead to therapeutic trials designed to improve left ventricular filling and delay the onset of overt cor pulmonale.
