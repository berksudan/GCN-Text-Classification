A mutation in the second nucleotide binding fold of the cystic fibrosis gene.
 The discovery last year of the deletion of a phenylalanine residue at amino acid position 508 of the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene has meant that approximately 70% of mutant chromosomes associated with CF can be accounted for.
 We report the finding of a substitution at nucleotide position 4041 of the CF gene, resulting in a change from asparagine to lysine at amino acid position 1303.
 We believe that this is a disease-causing mutation, as it involves a nonconservative amino acid change and has only been found on CF chromosomes with a consistent haplotype background.
 The mutation was detected using direct sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA and was confirmed by dot hybridization to both normal and mutant allele-specific oligonucleotides.
 The mutation was detected on three chromosomes from four individuals but not on any normal chromosome.
 Its presence in the heterozygous state is not correlated with the clinical status of the individual patients.
