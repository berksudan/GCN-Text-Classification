Quelprud's nodule: a post-auricular cartilaginous nodule.
 A number of minor variations to the configuration of the external ear are well recognized.
 This paper brings attention to one entity which is characterized by a small cartilaginous nodule or prominence arising from the posterior surface of the pinna and which we have named Quelprud's nodule.
 A prospective clinical survey of 208 patients attending an ENT clinic revealed that nearly one-third of the population studied possess this nodule.
 There was an equal sex incidence.
 The Quelprud's nodule was identified within families in a distribution which suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expressivity.
