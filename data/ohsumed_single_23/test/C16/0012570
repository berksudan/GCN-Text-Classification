Abnormal fucosylation of-ileal mucus in cystic fibrosis: II. A histochemical study using monoclonal antibodies to fucosyl oligosaccharides.
 Abnormal fucosylation of cystic fibrosis mucin was previously shown using peroxidase conjugated lectins on ileal tissue sections.
 These abnormally fucosylated glycoproteins were investigated further using monoclonal antibodies to fucosyl oligosaccharides based on type 1 and type 2 blood group precursor chains.
 The results of this study, using monoclonal antibodies to blood group glycoproteins in cystic fibrosis, were negative, yet abnormal fucosylation had been found using lectin histochemistry.
 Using monoclonal antibodies, lectins, and appropriate enzymes, such as glycosyl hydrolases, it should be possible to delineate further the abnormality found in glycoproteins in cystic fibrosis on appropriately fixed ileal sections, obtained from infants at term presenting with meconium ileus.
