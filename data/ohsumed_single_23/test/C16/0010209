Body composition in myelomeningocele.
 Body composition and measures of obesity were evaluated in 59 subjects with myelomeningocele (MMC), aged 0.3-29 y, by anthropometry and measures of body cell mass (BCM) and intra- and extracellular water (ICW and ECW), derived from total body potassium and deuterium-isotope dilution; these results were compared with reference data.
 Body composition was normal in preambulatory children with MMC.
 Beyond ages 3-4 y there was significant depletion of BCM and total body water, with maldistribution of water (increased ECW and decreased ICW) and increased percentage body fat above that expected for age and sex.
 These findings were more pronounced in females and in those with high lesions, and were less pronounced in those who remained ambulatory.
 These changes may result in metabolic and nutritional maladaption during stress.
 The relation of BCM, total body water depletion and increased ECW to decreasing ambulatory activity suggests that early nutritional and mobility programs warrant further study.
