Polyorchidism: case report and review of literature.
 Polyorchidism is a rare anomaly with approximately 70 cases reported in the literature.
 It may result from transverse division of the urogenital ridge, a hypothesis that best explains the anatomical features of the supernumerary testicle.
 The primary accompanying disorders and anomalies include maldescended testis, inguinal hernia and torsion.
 Malignancy has been reported in 3 cases.
 In the absence of any concomitant disorder and if testicular tumor can be ruled out by magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography, surgical exploration with biopsy is unnecessary.
