Radiographic manifestations of congenital heart disease in the adult patient.
 Improvements in the preoperative evaluation, surgical treatment, and postoperative care of patients with congenital cardiac disease have allowed a large patient population with congenital cardiac abnormalities to reach adolescence and adulthood.
 Noninvasive diagnostic imaging procedures (e.g., plain film radiography, echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) are playing an increasingly important role in the evaluation and management of adults with both treated and untreated congenital cardiac disease.
 The role of plain film radiology is emphasized.
