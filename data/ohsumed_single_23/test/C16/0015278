Tuberous sclerosis.
 Tuberous sclerosis is an inherited disorder characterized by a triad of signs--mental retardation, seizures and adenoma sebaceum.
 The hamartomas that commonly affect multiple organ systems can be seen on plain film radiography.
 Computed tomography and ultrasonography are useful for assessing whether lesions are present in the abdomen, kidneys and brain.
 The hamartomas tend to bleed, causing symptoms and prompting the need for evaluation.
