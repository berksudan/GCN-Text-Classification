Enamel pitting: a common symptom of tuberous sclerosis.
 Dental enamel pitting as a diagnostic sign of tuberous sclerosis is explored, and a protocol for the oral examination of patients and persons at risk is described.
 In this study 50 patients with tuberous sclerosis and 250 control patients were examined for dental enamel pitting.
 A simple clinical protocol was established for examination with the use of a dental disclosing solution swabbed on dry teeth.
 The incidence of enamel pitting in the adult dentition of patients with tuberous sclerosis was 100%, whereas that in the adult dentition of the control group was 7%.
 The simplicity of the test and the high probability of occurrence in tuberous sclerosis make such an examination useful in the diagnosis of this serious genetic disease.
