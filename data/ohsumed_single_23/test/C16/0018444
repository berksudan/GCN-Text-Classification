Pelvic support osteotomy in an unusual congenital dislocation of the hip. A 52-year follow-up study.
 Structural changes in the anatomy of the soft tissues as a result of long-standing congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH) are seldom described in the literature.
 Similarly, the anatomy of a hip 52 years after a pelvic support osteotomy for CDH seems not to have been previously observed.
 A long-term follow-up autopsy study of bilateral pelvic support osteotomies performed in a 91-year-old autopsy subject showed unexpectedly flattened sciatic nerves.
