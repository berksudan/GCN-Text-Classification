Cerebral blood flow, cross-brain oxygen extraction, and fontanelle pressure after hypoxic-ischemic injury in newborn infants.
 The relationship between mean arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, cerebral blood flow, cross-brain oxygen extraction, cerebral metabolic rate, and outcome was studied during therapy in nine neonates on 3 consecutive days after severe hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury.
 Cross-brain oxygen extraction was significantly higher (5.06 +/- 0.5 vs 2.05 +/- 0.8 ml/dl; p = 0.012) in the five neonates who survived with normal neurologic outcome than in the four who died or sustained severe brain damage.
 In contrast, global cerebral blood flow in the five neonates with normal neurologic outcome was significantly lower (25.6 +/- 8.2 vs 83.2 +/- 44.9 ml/100 gm brain/min; p less than 0.05) during the study period.
 The differences in cross-brain oxygen extraction and global cerebral blood flow between infants who had neurologic recovery and those who died or sustained brain damage occurred in the presence of acceptable values for intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure.
 Our preliminary data suggest that cross-brain oxygen extraction and possibly global cerebral blood flow may be important variables associated with severe neuronal injury and death after hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury.
