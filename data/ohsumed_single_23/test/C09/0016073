Modification of the fluorescent allergosorbent test as an inhibition assay for determination of cross-reactivity among aeroallergens.
 The fluorescent allergosorbent test was adapted as an inhibition assay to determine cross-reactivity between aeroallergens.
 With this method, similar antigenic determinants were found between short ragweed and giant ragweed, cocklebur, lamb's-quarter, rough pigweed, marsh elder, and goldenrod.
 Cocklebur and giant ragweed were highly potent in their ability to competitively bind to short ragweed IgE.
 The other pollens demonstrated lower potency of cross-reacting antigens.
 The fluorescent allergosorbent test-inhibition assay appears to be a useful method to determine cross-reactivity among aeroallergens.
