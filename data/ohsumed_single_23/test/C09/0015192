Acoustic reflectometry for assessment of hearing loss in children with middle ear effusion.
 We sought associations between acoustic reflectometry and hearing loss in ears with and without middle ear effusion in 137 New Zealand children ages 3 to 16 years.
 Reflectometry was significantly associated with conductive hearing loss.
 These associations were present in the entire sample; correlation coefficients varied between 0.31 at 2000 Hz (P less than 0.001) and 0.55 for a three frequency pure tone average (P less than 0.001).
 The associations persisted for the sample of ears deemed to be filled entirely by effusion; correlation coefficients varied between 0.27 at 4000 Hz (P = 0.026) and 0.47 at 500 Hz (P less than 0.001).
 Using a reflectivity of 6.0 or greater to detect a three frequency pure tone average loss of 30 dB or more, the sensitivity was 88% and the specificity was 44%.
 The technique of acoustic reflectometry should be explored and extended to permit rational decisions about management of middle ear effusions.
