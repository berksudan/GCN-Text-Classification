The response to human rIL-1, rIL-2, and rTNF in the middle ear of guinea pigs.
 Human recombinant interleukin 1 (rIL-1), interleukin 2 (rIL-2), or tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) were injected transtympanically into the middle ear of normal guinea pigs.
 Effusion volume and cellular content were determined after sacrifice and rapid dissection of the ear.
 By 24 hours, rIL-2 (100 U) had produced a cellular effusion (77% to 92% polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes), which cleared by 72 hours.
 rTNF (10 U) yielded a cellular effusion (12% to 67% lymphocytes) at 24 hours, which cleared by 48 hours.
 rIL-1 (100 U) did not produce significant effusion when compared to control.
 rIL-2 and rTNF cause an inflammatory effusion in the middle ear.
 To the extent they are generated in the middle ear during otitis media, these cytokines have the potential to contribute to the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion.
