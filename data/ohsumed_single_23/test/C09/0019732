Age-related balance changes in hearing-impaired children.
 This study compared balance skills of hearing-impaired children with those of hearing children in order to determine whether a deficit in balance exists in hearing-impaired children and to ascertain whether this deficit is age-related.
 Twenty-eight hearing-impaired subjects were chosen as a sample of convenience from the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf and placed into one of three age groups.
 Ten subjects were in the 4.5 to 6.5-year-old age group, 8 in the 8- to 10-year-old age group, and 10 in the 12.5 to 14.5-year-old age group.
 Selection criteria included bilateral sensorineural hearing loss of greater than or equal to 65 dB and normal intelligence (IQ greater than or equal to 80).
 Balance was measured by the use of the Balance subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency.
 For each age group, a z test was used to compare the subjects' scores with the Balance subtest standard scores.
 The results showed that for each age group, the mean score for the hearing-impaired children was lower than the standard score.
 Both older groups had significantly higher scores than the youngest group, but the mean scores of the older groups were not significantly different.
 No difference between the subjects' balance scores and the Balance subtest standard scores was found among the age groups, suggesting that the balance deficit was not age-related.
 Gender differences were not found for balance scores.
