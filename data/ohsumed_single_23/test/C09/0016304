The Glasgow Benefit Plot: a new method for reporting benefits from middle ear surgery.
 Conventionally, the results of middle ear surgery are reported in terms of postoperative closure of the air-bone gap or the improvement in air-conduction thresholds.
 While these are relevant in that they assess the technical success of the procedure and the lessening of monaural disability, they do not necessarily assess whether the patient has benefited.
 This is determined by many factors, not least of which is the hearing in the nonoperated ear.
 In this paper, we suggest that preoperative and postoperative plots of the air-conduction thresholds in both ears be used as an additional method of presenting the results.
 First, the proportion of patients that fall into each of three main preoperative impairment groups are identified.
 This is important, as the potential benefits from surgery are not the same in each group.
 Thereafter, the percentages of patients that achieve various postoperative hearing categories can be calculated, allowing surgeons to audit their results and make comparisons between series.
