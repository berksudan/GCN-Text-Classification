Stapedotomy technique and results: ten years' experience and comparative study with stapedectomy.
 Fifty of the 810 patients who underwent stapedotomy for otosclerosis from 1969 through 1988 were randomly chosen for follow-up of at least 5 years.
 Most of the patients (65%) had follow-up of 10 years after stapedotomy, but another 50 patients who underwent stapedectomy had follow-ups of longer than 10 years.
 In 50 patients, stapedectomy under local anesthesia was performed by removal of the footplate of the stapes, using an endaural incision, and covering the oval window with Gelfoam.
 In the other 50 patients, stapedotomy was performed under general anesthesia, using an endopreauricular incision, making a small hole in the footplate, and covering the hole only with blood from the surgical area.
 Although both groups showed improvement in hearing after the operation, the air-bone gap in the stapedotomy group was significantly better than that in the stapedectomy group.
 The use of the endopreauricular incision under general anesthesia was preferable to endaural incision under local anesthesia because the operative field was wider, more convenient for the surgeon, and conducive to patient safety.
 There were no significant complications in either group.
