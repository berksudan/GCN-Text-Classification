Microdrill versus perforator for stapedotomy.
 The purpose of this study was to compare the hearing results of performing stapedotomy using either a microdrill or a perforator.
 Two groups of patients, otherwise similar, were followed up for at least 2 years after the stapedotomy.
 It was possible to create 0.8 mm fenestra in 91.6% of our patients.
 There was no significant difference between the two groups in hearing results.
 The results showed a continuous improvement in the first 6 post-operative months after which the hearing stabilized.
 In our hands, the microdrill has not proved to be more traumatic than the perforator to the inner ear.
