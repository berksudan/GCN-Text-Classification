An improved stent method for choanal atresia repair.
 Short intranasal stents secured sublabially have a number of advantages.
 They provide secure fixation without an external ligature across the columella.
 The short length of the stents allows them to sit only in the operative area where the atretic plate had been removed.
 This lessens the chance of intranasal syechiae formation and eliminates the possibility of erosion in the anterior septal and nasal alar region from pressure exerted by a stent.
 Since the stents do not protrude from the nose, they cannot be grasped by infants or young children and are not visible externally.
 School-aged children who have undergone repair of a unilateral choanal atresia can attend school without having to suffer the embarrassment of being teased about a tube protruding from the nose.
 When compared with other stenting methods, the posterior stent is more secure and less likely to become dislodged.
