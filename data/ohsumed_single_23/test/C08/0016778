Treatment of intractable aspiration using a laryngeal stent or obturator.
 Twenty-five patients were treated with a laryngeal stent for potentially reversible chronic aspiration of life-threatening magnitude.
 The causes of the intractable aspiration were diverse and included chronic neurologic disease, extensive head and neck surgery, and severe gastroesophageal reflux.
 The advantages of this technique are noted in comparison to those of more invasive procedures.
 Disadvantages of the laryngeal stent and complications encountered are also covered.
 The long-term results show that all but one patient had a significant improvement in their chronic aspiration with the stent in place.
 However, only eight patients achieved adequate oral deglutition without aspiration following stent removal.
