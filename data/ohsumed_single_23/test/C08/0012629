Tracheostomy closure in restrictive respiratory insufficiency.
 A retrospective study is presented of 31 patients who required ventilatory support via a tracheostomy for periods of one month to 27 years whilst in a tertiary referral centre for the care of patients with restrictive respiratory insufficiency.
 All patients underwent closure of a long-standing tracheostomy.
 Post-operative follow-up periods of up to 16 years are documented.
 The indications for and the complications of tracheostomy closure in patients with severe chronic restrictive respiratory insufficiency requiring long-term respiratory support are discussed.
 It is concluded that the benefits of operative tracheostomy closure outweigh the disadvantages in this unusual type of patient.
