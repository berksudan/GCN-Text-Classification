Effects of ligation and embolization on Kf and multiple tracer measurements in dog lungs.
 In isolated blood-perfused dog lungs, the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf) and the permeability-surface area product of urea (PS) were measured to determine their responses to two different methods of altering filtration area: lobe ligation (LL, n = 5) and glass bead embolization (GBE, n = 4) during constant perfusion rates (700 +/- 45 ml/min).
 When two of three lobes were ligated, Kf decreased (1.36 +/- 0.13 to 0.58 +/- 0.23 g.min-1.cmH2O-1; P less than 0.05), but PS did not change (2.02 +/- 0.4 to 1.71 +/- 0.3 ml/s).
 Kf per gram of perfused blood-free dry lung weight was unchanged by LL (0.051 +/- 0.17 to 0.052 +/- 0.18 g.min-1.cmH2O-1), indicating that surface area per gram measured by Kf remained the same.
 However, PS per gram dry lung doubled (0.07 +/- 0.016 to 0.146 +/- 0.06 ml/s; P less than 0.05) after LL, suggesting that recruitment occurred in the remaining lobe.
 When three lobes were embolized with 200-microns glass beads (0.48 +/- 0.01 g beads/kg body wt), PS decreased (2.1 +/- 0.22 to 0.94 +/- 0.09 ml/s; P less than 0.05), but Kf was not altered (1.01 +/- 0.17 to 1.04 +/- 0.18 g.min-1.cmH2O-1).
 The constancy of Kf after GBE implies that the vascular pressure increase during the Kf measurement was transmitted to both blocked and flowing vessels and thereby measured the same filtration area before and after GBE.
 PS decreased significantly after GBE because of a loss of perfused surface area by the beads blocking flow in small arterial vessels.
