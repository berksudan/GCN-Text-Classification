Treatment of limited small-cell lung cancer with concurrent etoposide/cisplatin and radiotherapy followed by intensification with high-dose cyclophosphamide: a Southwest Oncology Group study.
 Between March 1986 and May 1988, the Southwest Oncology Group enrolled 58 previously untreated patients with limited small-cell lung cancer on a treatment program that administered high-dose cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg) as late intensification.
 Treatment consisted of induction chemo-radiotherapy, (weeks 1 to 11), consolidation chemotherapy (weeks 11 to 18), and intensification (week 18).
 Median age was 61.5 years.
 Eighty-nine percent of patients had a Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) performance status of 0-1.
 Twenty-one patients completed all prescribed treatments.
 There were seven treatment-related deaths, four as a result of intensification.
 Fifty-six patients are available for response analysis.
 Thirty-two patients achieved a complete remission (CR) (57%) and fifteen achieved a partial remission (PR) (26%).
 Median survival for all patients is 11.1 months.
 Among the 21 patients who received intensification, nine remain alive in a CR with a median survival of 27 months.
 This sequence of treatments was not associated with a survival advantage for the group as a whole, possibly because of the toxicity of induction and consolidation treatment and the delayed administration of high-dose cyclophosphamide.
