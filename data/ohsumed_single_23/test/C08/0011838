Expression of neurophysin-related precursor in cell membranes of a small-cell lung carcinoma.
 A monoclonal antibody (mAb L6) to a small-cell lung carcinoma surface antigen recognizes a common epitope of vasopressin-neurophysin and oxytocin-neurophysin in hypothalamic nuclei.
 We now report on the identification of a neurophysin-like precursor in human lung carcinoma (LX-1) cell membrane.
 mAb L6 immunoaffinity chromatography of solubilized membranes resulted in a single band of approximately 45 kDa.
 Western blot analysis demonstrated immunoreactivity of this band with mAb L6, anti-vasopressin, and an antibody to the vasopressin precursor, pro-pressophysin.
 N-terminal sequencing of this band demonstrated a 21-amino acid homology with the N terminus of human pro-pressophysin, and substitution of a Cys33 residue in the tumor antigen with Arg33.
 Absence of immunoreactivity with the antibodies described above in cytosolic extracts and culture medium suggests nonsecretion of processed or intact pro-pressophysin-like peptide.
 Northern analysis of LX-1 mRNA with a 30-mer to the C terminus of rat pro-pressophysin resulted in a band of approximately 1000 base pairs, 250 base pairs larger than hypothalamic message.
 In situ hybridization of LX-1 tumor-bearing nude rat brain with the same probe demonstrated specific hybridization in rat hypothalamus and xenografted tumor.
 These findings suggest expression of a pro-pressophysin-like protein in this tumor cell line that is preferentially targeted to the cell membrane.
