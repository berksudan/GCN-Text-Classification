Vocal fold sulcus.
 Vocal fold sulcus is a cause of dysphonia which has not been recognized until recently.
 Awareness of its existence combined with use of laryngostroboscopy would enhance the management of this group of patients.
 Five such cases were treated initially by voice therapy and subsequently combined with microlaryngeal Teflon injections of the vocal cord.
 Representative photomicrographs and the end results of treatment are presented.
 A good voice, subjectively and objectively, was obtained in three patients, with satisfactory improvement in the other two.
