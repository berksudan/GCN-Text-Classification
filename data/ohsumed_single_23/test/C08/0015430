Quantitation of abnormal 67Ga uptake in pulmonary interstitial vascular disease--a new test to detect diffuse lung disease.
 Gallium 67 has been used as a modality to diagnose and follow the clinical course of diseases such as tumors, infections, inflammatory disorders, and interstitial lung disease.
 It has been appreciated, however, that mild to moderate changes in scan activity, when these disorders are followed over time, are less than optimal.
 SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) scanning is a new technique designed to obviate this problem.
 SPECT scanning utilizes computer acquisition to provide three-dimensional scanning and the additional benefit of colorization to aid in discerning differences of uptake.
 SPECT scanning was performed on 22 patients with interstitial lung disease of various etiologies.
 Additionally, 7 patients had follow-up SPECT scanning to determine their response to treatment.
 Two patients are presented as examples.
