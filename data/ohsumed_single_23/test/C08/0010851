Intravenous streptomycin.
 Streptomycin is an effective drug for the treatment of tuberculosis.
 It is currently recommended for use only by the intramuscular route.
 This method of drug delivery is accompanied by considerable pain which is unacceptable to many patients.
 With the advent of many improvements in intravenous therapy that have occurred in the past 40 years, reevaluation of the intravenous use of this drug is warranted.
 We describe the short-term use of intravenous streptomycin in four patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.
