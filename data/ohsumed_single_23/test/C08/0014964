Treatment of atelectasis with selective bronchial suctioning. Use of a curved-tipped catheter with a guide mark.
 We applied our technique of selective bronchial suctioning (SBS) for the treatment of atelectasis (AT) of middle and lower lobes; nine patients with refractory ATs were successfully treated.
 We considered that SBS using a curve-tipped catheter with a guide mark (CTCGM) is the technique of choice for the treatment of refractory AT when conventional respiratory therapy is not effective and a bronchoscopist is not available.
