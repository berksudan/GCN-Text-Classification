Perioperative effect of methylprednisolone given during lung surgery on plasma concentrations of C3a and C5a.
 Methylprednisolone or saline (placebo) solution was infused intravenously in 28 patients undergoing elective lobectomy for lung cancer.
 The state of the complement system during and after surgery and the effects of methylprednisolone on biologically active products of complement were studied by measurements of plasma C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins and leukocyte counts in peripheral blood perioperatively.
 In the placebo group plasma concentrations of C3a were significantly increased on postoperative days 1 and 2, whereas C5a had risen significantly 6 hours after surgery and on days 1 and 2.
 Methylprednisolone infusion during surgery eliminated the postoperative elevation of C3a and C5a.
 The postoperative leukocyte count in peripheral blood was higher in the methylprednisolone group than in the controls.
 The observations indicated that methylprednisolone may reduce the influx of leukocytes from peripheral blood into the airways by attenuating production of biologically active complements.
