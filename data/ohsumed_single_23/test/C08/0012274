Factor analysis in difficult tracheal intubation: laryngoscopy-induced airway obstruction.
 We have studied eight patients with a history of difficult tracheal intubation, using x-ray laryngoscopy and local anaesthesia, a curved Macintosh blade and a standard intubating position.
 The view obtained was better than recorded previously during general anaesthesia in two patients, and in a third the x-ray showed that positioning the blade tip beneath the epiglottis would have improved vision, suggesting that reproducibility of the assessment may not be consistent.
 The "ease of intubation" and "complementary" angles may be helpful in the assessment of such patients.
 A "peardrop" effect is described whereby during laryngoscopy, the epiglottis became pressed against the posterior pharyngeal wall as a result of tongue compression.
 In the absence of muscle paralysis, removal of the blade caused immediate correction.
 However, during anaesthesia with neuromuscular block it is suggested that this not only occurs more readily but, may not correct when the blade is removed.
 Iatrogenic airway obstruction during moderately difficult tracheal intubation may be common and should be anticipated.
