Pneumothorax in a patient with Wegener's granulomatosis during treatment with immunosuppressive agents.
 We present the case of a 16-year-old woman with Wegener's granulomatosis, who developed a pneumothorax while receiving treatment with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids.
 The lung was re-expanded by tube drainage, and the patient recovered completely while the immunosuppressive treatment was continued in combination with sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim.
 A possible role for this antimicrobial drug in the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis is briefly discussed.
