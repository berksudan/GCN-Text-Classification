Upper respiratory tract infections.
 Upper respiratory tract infections are among the most common acute infections in humans.
 This review discusses the clinically important aspects of the epidemiology, etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, complications, and prevention of the common cold, pharyngitis, otitis media, and sinusitis.
 Most episodes of the common cold and pharyngitis are of viral origin, and curative therapy is not available.
 Streptococcal pharyngitis, acute otitis media, and sinusitis are secondary to bacterial infections, and antibiotic therapy is important.
