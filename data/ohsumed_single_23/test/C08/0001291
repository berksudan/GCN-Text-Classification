The effect of sulindac on the abnormal cough reflex associated with dry cough.
 In order to determine the possible role of prostaglandins in the abnormal cough reflex in patients with dry cough, the effects of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor on cough symptoms were examined.
 This was measured by a cough symptom score and by the cough reflex sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin in a double blind, randomized, cross-over study comparing the effects of placebo with sulindac, 200 mg daily for 1 week.
 We studied six hypertensive patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-associated cough and six patients with an idiopathic, dry, unproductive cough, all of whom had an increase in the sensitivity of the cough reflex.
 There was no change in blood pressure control in the hypertensive patients during sulindac therapy.
 The patients with the angiotensin converting enzyme-associated cough had a significant reduction in the cough symptom score and also a significant increase in the dose of capsaicin causing two or more coughs (threshold sensitivity) and that causing five or more coughs (near maximum response) during sulindac therapy as compared to placebo.
 In those patients with idiopathic, dry, unproductive cough, sulindac did not alter the symptom of cough or the cough reflex response to capsaicin.
 These results suggest that prostaglandins may be involved in cough associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, but are less likely to be important in the pathogenesis of more common dry coughs of unknown cause.
