Single-lung transplantation for pulmonary vascular disease.
 Six patients with end-stage pulmonary vascular disease received right SLTs.
 Though patients generally had difficult early postoperative courses, four of the six have survived from 3 to 23 months and have achieved good recovery of right ventricular function and good functional results.
 SLT is a viable option in selected patients with severe pulmonary hypertension even when right ventricular function is severely impaired.
