Apical opacity associated with pulmonary tuberculosis: high-resolution CT findings.
 To elucidate the nature of the apical opacity that is commonly seen in patients with tuberculosis--usually referred to as an "apical cap" or "apical pleural thickening"--18 patients with upper lobe tuberculosis were studied with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).
 All had a homogeneous apical opacity at least 1 cm thick on chest radiographs.
 Fifteen of the 18 had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis of more than 5 years duration, and nine showed evidence of ipsilateral pleurisy.
 HRCT scans at the apex of the thorax in all nine patients scanned at this level showed that extrapleural fat with interspersed vessels accounted for most of the plain radiographic opacity.
 Scans obtained at a level slightly above visible aerated lung showed extrapleural fat 3-25 mm thick peripherally and atelectatic lung centrally.
 At more caudal levels, at which both aerated lung and "thickened pleura" were visible on plain radiographs, HRCT showed extrapleural fat (3-20 mm thick), thickened pleura (1-3 mm thick), and atelectatic lung peripherally and areas of emphysematous bullae, bronchiectasis, and atelectatic lung centrally.
