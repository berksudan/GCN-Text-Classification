Immune reactivity in bronchogenic carcinoma and its relation to 5-year survival rate.
 We performed a prospective study on the correlation of various parameters of the immune response with the 5-year survival rate in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma.
 Parameters were initially examined before starting treatment.
 Delayed hypersensitivity skin tests, lymphoblastogenesis, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production were employed to assess immune competence.
 Each reaction was classified into four or five grades in accordance with intensity; the 5-year survival rate of the patients showing each grade of the immune response was calculated.
 A correlation between response before treatment and the survival rate was most clearly noted for lymphoblastogenesis.
 The skin tests and the NK cell activity showed poorer correlations, and no exact correlation was noted between the IL-2 production and the immune response.
