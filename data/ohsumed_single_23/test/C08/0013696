Lung abscess: CT-guided drainage.
 Lung abscesses were drained by means of catheters guided by computed tomography (CT) in 19 patients who still had sepsis despite standard medical therapy; all patients had received antibiotics for at least 5 days, and 11 of the 19 patients had undergone bronchoscopy.
 The abscess was cured (by clinical and radiographic criteria) in all 19 patients (100%), and surgery was avoided in 16 of the 19 patients (84%).
 Three patients underwent surgery for removal of organized tissue or decortication after the lung abscess was evacuated.
 Complications included a hemothorax that required a chest tube in one patient and three minor complications (a clogged catheter in two patients and transient elevation of intracerebral pressure in one patient).
 The hemothorax occurred in one of two patients in whom the catheter traversed normal lung.
 The percutaneous drainage catheters traversed juxtaposed abnormal pleura on route to the abscess in 17 of the patients.
 CT-guided drainage of lung abscess is an effective method to treat lung abscesses that are refractory to conventional therapy; the procedure should obviate major operation in most patients.
 A catheter route through abscess-pleural syndesis is preferable, and CT is useful for planning this route.
