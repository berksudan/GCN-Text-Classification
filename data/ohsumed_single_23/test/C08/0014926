Magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of pulmonary infarction.
 We report for the first time, to our knowledge, MRI features which could differentiate noninvasively pulmonary infarction from pneumonia.
 Three subjects with angiographically proven pulmonary infarction showed high T1 weighted MRI signals located in the embolic territory.
 Three patients with pneumonia and one patient with emboli, but without infarction, did not have these T1 weighted images.
