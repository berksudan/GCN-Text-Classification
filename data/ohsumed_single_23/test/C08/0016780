Surgical applications of ultrathin flexible bronchoscopes in infants.
 Ultrathin flexible bronchoscopes with controlled distal angulation allow the conventional diagnostic examination of the lower airways of even the smallest infants.
 These instruments may be passed through small endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes while ventilation is maintained.
 It is thus possible, under direct visualization, to control the manipulation of surgical instruments where they could not otherwise be seen, or to study airway dynamics and anatomy intraoperatively without extubating the patient.
