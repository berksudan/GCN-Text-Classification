Compensation of respiratory alkalosis induced after acclimation to simulated altitude.
 Conscious intact rats previously acclimated for 3 wk to barometric pressure of 370-380 Torr (3WHx) were made alkalotic for 3 h by a decrease in inspired O2 fraction from 0.10 to 0.075 at ambient barometric pressure (730-740 Torr).
 Controls were normoxic littermates (Nx) in which inspired O2 fraction was lowered from approximately 0.21 to 0.10 for 3 h.
 Arterial PCO2 decreased progressively and similarly in both groups (65-70% of control at 15 min).
 Initially, arterial pH increased less in 3WHx (0.09 +/- 0.004 vs.
 0.15 +/- 0.008).
 As hypocapnia continued, delta[HCO3-]/delta pH (mmol.l-1.pH) became more negative in Nx, from -15.2 +/- 2.5 at 15 min to -37.0 +/- 2.9 at 3 h, indicating nonrespiratory compensation of alkalosis.
 In 3WHx, delta[HCO3-]/delta pH did not change during alkalosis.
 Cumulative renal excretion of base (mueq/100 g) during alkalosis increased by 73.2 +/- 11.1 in Nx and 25.4 +/- 7.3 in 3WHx.
 This difference was mainly due to a larger increase in HCO3- excretion in Nx.
 The data suggest that the smaller compensation of hypocapnic alkalosis in 3WHx is partly due to the smaller increase in renal base excretion.
 Because base availability limits renal base excretion, the smaller renal response of 3WHx may be secondary to the low plasma HCO3- concentration that accompanies altitude acclimation.
