Interstitial lung disease: impact of postprocessing in digital storage phosphor imaging.
 The ability to resolve the fine linear structures of interstitial lung disease is one measure of the limiting performance characteristics of an imaging system.
 Conventional screen-film radiography was compared with six algorithms of isodose storage phosphor digital radiography (0.2-mm x 10-bit pixel matrix) in the detection of interstitial lung abnormality documented by means of computed tomography in 40 patients with abnormalities and 25 healthy control subjects.
 Performance was evaluated with an analysis of variance (the Fisher paired comparison test; P less than .05) of the average receiver operating characteristic area of 2,730 observations by six readers.
 The moderately and the more markedly high-frequency edge-enhanced algorithms of storage phosphor digital radiographs were equivalent in performance to screen-film radiography.
 The default mode, low- and medium-frequency edge-enhanced algorithms, and gray scale reversed mode of storage phosphor digital radiography were inferior to screen-film radiography.
 The authors conclude that high-frequency edge-enhanced algorithms can perform as well as screen-film radiography in the detection of interstitial disease.
