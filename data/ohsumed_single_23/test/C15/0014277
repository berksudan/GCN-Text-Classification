Sarcoidosis of the cauda equina: a report of three cases.
 Three cases of sarcoidosis of the cauda equina are presented.
 In two there was no previous history suggestive of sarcoidosis and the presentation was one of a painful flaccid paralysis; in these the diagnosis was made after myelography and laminectomy with subsequent histology.
 The third patient had a previous diagnosis of lupus pernio and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to aid diagnosis.
 Only two previous cases have been reported of sarcoidosis presenting in the cauda equina with no other systemic manifestations.
 This is the first report of the use of MRI in sarcoidosis of the lower meninges.
