Ceftazidime-induced hemolysis in a patient with drug-dependent antibodies reactive by immune complex and drug adsorption mechanisms.
 A 35-year-old woman developed acute intravascular hemolysis within five days of beginning a course of ceftazidime.
 The direct antiglobulin test became strongly positive with both anti-IgG and anticomplement.
 The serum contained an antibody that, in the presence of ceftazidime, sensitized unmodified reagent cells with IgG and complement (immune-complex type).
 The serum also agglutinated ceftazidime-pretreated cells at room temperature and 37 degrees C (drug-adsorption type).
 Retrospective testing disclosed that the drug adsorption antibody, which had been present before the current course of antibiotics, was not demonstrable during the hemolysis.
 The reactivity of the immune complex antibody, which developed by the second day of ceftazidime, paralleled the degree of hemolysis and the strength of the direct antiglobulin test.
 The authors believe that this patient had two separate ceftazidime-dependent antibodies and that the antibody reactive by immune complex mechanism mediated an episode of acute intravascular hemolysis.
