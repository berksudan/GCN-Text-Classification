Prenatal screening for hemoglobinopathies. I. A prospective regional trial.
 Prenatal hemoglobinopathy screening was chosen as a model system for the study of patient receptivity to unsolicited genetic information.
 Providers of prenatal care in Rochester, NY, were offered free testing of all their prenatal patients and genetic counseling of women found positive.
 The 18,907 prenatal samples tested in a 5-year period represented 35.1% of the pregnancies in the Rochester metropolitan region.
 A hemoglobinopathy was found in 810 pregnancies (4.3%).
 Of the 21 different types of hemoglobinopathies detected, the most common were sickle cell trait (59%), hemoglobin C trait (19%), beta-thalassemia trait (11%), and hemoglobin E trait (5%).
 At the time of phlebotomy, 75% of the pregnancies were of less than 18 wk duration.
 Sixty-six percent of the pregnancies occurred in patients unaware of their diagnosis, and 80% occurred in patients unaware that they might be at risk for a child with a serious blood disorder.
 Of the 810 positive pregnancies, 551 (68%) occurred in patients who came for counseling.
 Of 453 women counseled during their first screened pregnancy, 390 (86%) said they wanted their partners tested and 254 (55%) had their partner tested.
 In the 77 pregnancies thus found to be at risk, the couple was too late for prenatal diagnosis in 12 cases, and the condition for which the fetus was at risk was too mild in 12 cases.
 Prenatal diagnosis was offered in the remaining 53 pregnancies and was accepted by 25 couples (47%).
 These results indicate that unselected patients in the primary care setting in this region, even though pregnant, are receptive to and utilize genetic information.
