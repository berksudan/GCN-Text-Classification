Molecular basis for alpha-thalassemia associated with the structural mutant hemoglobin Suan-Dok (alpha 2 109leu----arg) [published erratum appears in Blood 1991 Mar 15;77(6):1404].
 Hemoglobin (Hb) Suan-Dok (alpha 109Arg) is a rare alpha-globin structural mutation that is linked to an alpha-thalassemia (alpha-thal) determinant.
 When inherited in trans to an alpha-thal-1 mutation (-), it results in Hb H disease associated with low levels (9%) of the Suan-Dok Hb.
 The nature of the thalassemic defect associated with the alpha SD mutation has been investigated by structural and functional studies.
 Sequence analysis of the cloned Suan-Dok allele showed a missense mutation (T----G) at codon 109 in an otherwise normal alpha 2-globin gene.
 When the alpha 2SD-globin gene was introduced into mouse erythroleukemia cells, the steady state alpha-globin messenger RNA (mRNA) level was equivalent to the alpha A-globin gene control.
 Although in vitro translation of a synthetic alpha 2SD-globin mRNA generated levels of alpha globin equivalent to alpha 2A-globin mRNA at early time points, the ratio of alpha SD to alpha A globin decreased markedly at later time points.
 These data suggest that the thalassemic defect associated with the Suan-Dok mutation results from a significant instability of the alpha SD globin.
