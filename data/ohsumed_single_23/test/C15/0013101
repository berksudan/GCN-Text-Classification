Venous Doppler ultrasonography in the fetus with nonimmune hydrops.
 Eighteen pregnancies with nonimmune hydrops fetalis were referred for fetal echocardiography to rule out congenital heart disease.
 In 14 of these cases, pulsating blood velocities were recorded in the umbilical vein, which in a normal population had a nonpulsatile blood velocity pattern.
 The four cases without pulsations in the umbilical vein were found to have intrauterine viral infections.
 In the last 10 cases examined, the umbilical venous pulsations were found to reflect abnormal central venous pulsations during atrial systole suggesting increased fetal central venous pressure.
 Right ventricular shortening fraction was significantly decreased in the group with umbilical venous pulsations compared with those without (0.18 versus 0.32, p less than 0.05).
 All the fetuses without venous pulsations survived, but only four of the 14 with pulsations survived (p less than 0.05).
 The results suggest that blood velocity recordings in the umbilical and central veins of the fetus can give valuable clinical information with regard to the presence of fetal congestive heart failure and differentiate between this physiologic state and other causes of nonimmune hydrops fetalis.
 This may have implications for fetal diagnostic work-up and prognosis.
