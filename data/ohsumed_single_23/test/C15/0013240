Combined use of fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination and tuberculin skin test in the diagnosis of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis. A prospective study.
 A prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of combined use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytologic examination and Mantoux test in the diagnosis of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis was carried out.
 Tuberculin reactions were determined in 59 control subjects.
 Preoperative FNA cytologic examinations and Mantoux tests were performed on 74 patients with cervical lymphadenopathy.
 The lymph nodes were then excised and examined histologically and cultured for mycobacteria.
 Forty-eight, 22, and 4 patients had histologically confirmed tuberculous, non-specific, and malignant lymphadenopathy.
 Fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination alone could detect cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis in 37 patients (77%).
 The predictive value of a strong tuberculin reaction for mycobacterial infection was 100%.
 The combined use of a Mantoux test and FNA cytologic examination was able to diagnose 43 (90%) of 48 cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis cervical preoperatively.
 Combined use of FNA cytologic examination and Mantoux test was efficient in the diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis.
