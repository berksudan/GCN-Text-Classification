Hemoglobin Cagliari (beta 60 [E4] Val----Glu): a novel unstable thalassemic hemoglobinopathy.
 This report describes a patient with thalassemia intermedia-like phenotype born to normal parents in whom globin gene sequencing detected a novel abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) due to a T to A substitution at codon 60 of the beta-globin gene arising as a de novo mutation.
 Normal sequences were detected at the homologous beta-globin locus.
 This mutation results in the substitution of a polar (glutamic acid) for a nonpolar (valine) residue near the corner of the heme pocket of the beta-globin chain.
 The novel variant has been designated Hb Cagliari, from the place of birth of the propositus.
 Kinetics of globin synthesis performed following splenectomy suggest that this new Hb variant is synthesized at a near normal rate but undergoes rapid breakdown.
 The extreme lability of the variant explains the clinical and hematologic picture characterized by marked ineffective erythropoiesis, thalassemia-like bone changes, iron overload, high proportion of Hb F in the peripheral blood, reduced beta/alpha-globin chain synthesis ratio in peripheral blood reticulocytes, and absence of the abnormal Hb in peripheral blood at extensive protein structural analysis before splenectomy.
 This case indicates that a thalassemic hemoglobinopathy should be suspected in the presence of a patient with a thalassemia intermedia-like phenotype born to normal parents, even when protein structural analysis fails to detect an abnormal Hb.
 DNA sequencing may allow to define the mutation, thus making the proper diagnosis.
