Decreased content and surface expression of alpha-granule membrane protein GMP-140 in one of two types of platelet alpha delta storage pool deficiency.
 To determine whether alpha-granule membranes are present in platelets of patients with storage pool deficiencies of both alpha and dense granules (alpha delta-SPD), we examined the content and surface expression of the alpha-granule membrane protein GMP-140 in one patient (J.C.) with a severe alpha-granule deficiency and in three members of a family (family C) with milder alpha-granule deficiencies.
 Surface expression of GMP-140 in stimulated platelets, assessed by flow cytometric measurements of the binding of two anti-GMP-140 monoclonal antibodies, was 24-38% of normal values in platelets from patient J.C., vs.
 60-95% of normal values in family C.
 Total platelet content of GMP-140, determined in platelet lysates by antigen-capture ELISA, was 49% of normal in patient J.C., but normal in the members of family C.
 Platelets of patient J.C.
 were found to be heterogeneous with respect to GMP-140 content and surface expression by both flow cytometry and immunogold electron microscopy.
 Approximately 80% of her platelets expressed little or no GMP-140 after stimulation, whereas the remaining 20% expressed normal amounts of GMP-140 and showed extensive immunogold labeling of typical alpha-granules and clear vacuoles.
 No such heterogeneity was found in platelets from family C.
 These findings in the severe alpha delta-SPD patient are in clear contrast to the observations of normal GMP-140 content in the three other alpha delta-SPD patients, and in patients with the gray platelet syndrome, reported previously by others.
 These results illustrate the phenotypic heterogeneity of alpha-granule deficiencies in human platelets, and suggest that a defect in granule formation in the megakaryocytes may account for the alpha-granule defect in at least one form of alpha delta-SPD.
