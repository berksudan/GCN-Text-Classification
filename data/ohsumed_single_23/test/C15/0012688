Recognition of distinctive patterns of gallium-67 distribution in sarcoidosis.
 Assessment of gallium-67 (67Ga) uptake in the salivary and lacrimal glands and intrathoracic lymph nodes was made in 605 consecutive patients including 65 with sarcoidosis.
 A distinctive intrathoracic lymph node 67Ga uptake pattern, resembling the Greek letter lambda, was observed only in sarcoidosis (72%).
 Symmetrical lacrimal gland and parotid gland 67Ga uptake (panda appearance) was noted in 79% of sarcoidosis patients.
 A simultaneous lambda and panda pattern (62%) or a panda appearance with radiographic bilateral, symmetrical, hilar lymphadenopathy (6%) was present only in sarcoidosis patients.
 The presence of either of these patterns was particularly prevalent in roentgen Stages I (80%) or II (74%).
 We conclude that simultaneous (a) lambda and panda images, or (b) a panda image with bilateral symmetrical hilar lymphadenopathy on chest X-ray represent distinctive patterns which are highly specific for sarcoidosis, and may obviate the need for invasive diagnostic procedures.
