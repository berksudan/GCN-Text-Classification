Misperceptions of comprehension difficulties of stroke patients by doctors, nurses and relatives.
 Doctors, nurses and relatives involved with 30 recently aphasic stroke patients were asked to predict how the patient would perform on a comprehension test.
 Results show that not only do doctors, nurses and relatives underestimate the receptive disability of these patients, but they also illustrate a lack of agreement between health professionals.
 Implications for management are considered.
