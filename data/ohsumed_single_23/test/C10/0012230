Sudden cervical pain: spontaneous cervical epidural hematoma.
 Three cases of cervical epidural hematoma are reported.
 Acute neck pain usually associated with a mild effort, closely followed by radicular pain and a neurologic deficit below the lesion is the typical presentation of this extremely rare and difficult diagnosis.
 As prognosis depends on preoperative neurologic state, the authors emphasize the importance of prompt identification of this lesion.
 The diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomography, and emergency neurosurgical laminectomy is mandatory.
