Electroencephalographic parameters in assessing the cognitive function of children with epilepsy.
 Many biological and psychological possibilities have to be considered when attempting to explain cognitive dysfunction in the individual child with epilepsy.
 Electroencephalographic (EEG) information, which may be particularly relevant in some children, has mainly been studied in relation to the possible direct effects of seizure discharges on learning and behavior.
 Such discharges can be divided into transient, brief or prolonged.
 Prolonged seizure discharges includes nonconvulsive status epilepticus during wakefulness and status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep.
 In addition to the influence of seizure discharges, preliminary findings suggest that some children with epilepsy might have a subtle disorder of arousal mechanisms in sleep, possibly associated with impaired daytime performance.
