Spontaneous decompression of syringomyelia: magnetic resonance imaging findings. Case report.
 The case of a 30-year-old woman with Chiari I malformation and a cervicothoracic syrinx is presented.
 The patient was followed clinically over a 2 1/2-year period.
 Spontaneous and complete resolution of the syrinx, as documented by serial magnetic resonance studies, was accompanied by only a minimal change in objective symptomatology.
