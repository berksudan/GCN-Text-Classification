Inconsistent response to divalproex sodium in hemichorea/hemiballism.
 We report 6 patients with hemichorea/hemiballism of vascular origin who were treated with divalproex sodium (Depakote).
 Four of 6 responded initially.
 Marked improvement was seen in 2 patients only and in 1 of these hemiballism recurred despite continuing therapy.
 Divalproex sodium is not uniformly effective in the treatment of hemichorea/hemiballism.
