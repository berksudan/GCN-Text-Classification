Orocaecal transit time in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
 Smooth muscle degeneration may occur in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
 We measured fasting orocaecal transit time in patients with advanced Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other muscular dystrophies and in healthy controls.
 No significant differences were found.
 In contrast to reports of gastric hypomotility in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, we found no evidence of impaired small intestinal motility.
