Meralgia paresthetica after coronary bypass surgery.
 Meralgia paresthetica is a neurologic disorder characterized by localized paresthesia and numbness on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh and involving the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.
 It involves no motor deficits.
 Meralgia paresthetica, which may result from a variety of causes, has been observed as a rare complication in heart operations.
 Its cause when associated with such operations is uncertain but may be prolonged relaxed positioning on the operating table and recovery room stretcher.
 Another possible cause of meralgia paresthetica after heart operations is the "frog-leg" position of the legs during vein harvesting.
 Patients with this condition should be advised of its untreatable, but benign and self-limiting, nature.
