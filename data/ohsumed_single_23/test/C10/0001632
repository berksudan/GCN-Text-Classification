Right-left disorientation in dementia of the Alzheimer type.
 We demonstrated that right-left orientation (R/L-O) on a confronting subject is more impaired in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type than in patients with multi-infarct dementia of comparable degree of dementia.
 The impairment in R/L-O is independent of aphasia and spatial disorientation.
