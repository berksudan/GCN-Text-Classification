Cerebral venography with MR.
 The authors describe a two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiography technique to create projection venograms of the head.
 The technique was applied to 27 healthy volunteers and 39 patients.
 The superior sagittal and straight sinuses, the internal cerebral veins, and the Galen vein were visualized in all the volunteers.
 Other veins were seen in a high percentage of subjects.
 Systematic comparison of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) after intraarterial contrast medium injection and MR venography in patients showed good correlation between the two techniques.
 MR venography proved helpful in identifying thrombosis or patency of cerebral veins and sinuses and showed collateral venous drainage and venous drainage from arteriovenous malformations.
 There was good correlation between conventional contrast angiography and MR venography.
 In conclusion, MR venography is considered reliable for showing the cerebral venous system and provides information additional to that of conventional spin-echo imaging.
