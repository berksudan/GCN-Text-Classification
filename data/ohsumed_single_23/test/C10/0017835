Sleepwalking precipitated by treatment of sleep apnea with nasal CPAP.
 A 33-year-old man with a long history of snoring, observed apneic episodes, and excessive daytime sleepiness, underwent all-night polysomnography, which demonstrated severe obstructive sleep apnea.
 During the nasal CPAP trial, two episodes of sleepwalking were observed during a period of delta sleep rebound.
