Antemortem diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease.
 Using the presence of widespread cortical Lewy bodies (LB) as the pathologic criteria of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), we describe serial neurologic and mental status examinations in 6 patients with DLBD, 3 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 1 patient with Parkinson's disease (PD).
 The 6 patients with DLBD included 3 with neocortical neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) consistent with coincident AD.
 Most patients with DLBD had gait impairment concurrent with mild to moderate dementia.
 Abnormalities of tone or resting tremor were also prominent early symptoms in the subjects with DLBD, but not AD.
 Patients with DLBD frequently had abnormal EEGs with background posterior slowing and a frontally dominant burst pattern at the time of mild to moderate dementia.
 Agitation, hallucinations, and delusions were frequent early symptoms in DLBD patients.
 Patients with DLBD without concomitant AD had numerous Alz-50 negative cortical plaques.
 Patients with DLBD have a distinct clinical syndrome that can be differentiated from AD.
 Pathologic features, including the absence of Alz-50 immunoreactivity, also differentiate DLBD from AD.
