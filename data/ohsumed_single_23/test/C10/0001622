Abnormal pulsatile secretion of luteinizing hormone in men with epilepsy: relationship to laterality and nature of paroxysmal discharges.
 We compared the pulsatile secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) between 13 men with clinically and electrographically documented temporal lobe seizures and 8 age-matched controls.
 Serum for LH measurement was drawn every 15 minutes during 8 hours of EEG telemetry in both groups.
 The 2 groups did not differ significantly in average mean baseline LH secretion, total LH secretion, or average pulse amplitude.
 The group with seizures, however, showed a significantly greater (p less than 0.05) variability of baseline LH secretion and pulse frequency.
 Among the men with unilateral paroxysmal EEG findings, pulse frequency was significantly greater (p = 0.05) with right epileptiform discharges or left slowing (6.4 +/- 0.4) than with left epileptiform discharges or right slowing (3.0 +/- 1.3).
 The relationship of pulse frequency to the nature and laterality of paroxysmal discharges makes it unlikely that endocrine abnormalities can be attributed to medication alone and strengthens the notion that temporal lobe epileptiform discharges may disrupt hypothalamic regulation of pituitary secretion.
