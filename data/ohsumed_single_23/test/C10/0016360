Infarction in the anterior rostral cerebellum (the territory of the lateral branch of the superior cerebellar artery).
 We report 9 patients with an isolated infarct of the anterior part of the rostral cerebellum, ie, the territory of the lateral branch of the superior cerebellar artery.
 Clinicoanatomic correlations are based on CT, MRI, or both in 8 patients and on pathologic data in the ninth.
 The main clinical features were ipsilateral dysmetria and axial lateropulsion, dysarthria, and unsteadiness.
 In 1 patient, the clinical presentation mimicked a lacunar stroke (dysarthria and clumsy hand syndrome).
 There were no edematous cerebellar infarcts with signs of brainstem compression, and all patients spontaneously improved without significant sequellae.
 Angiography in 2 patients and pathologic examination of arteries in 1 patient disclosed no occlusion in the vertebrobasilar system.
 Six patients had a cardiac source of emboli.
 In conclusion, infarcts of the anterior part of the rostral cerebellum can be regarded as a benign condition in which there is, frequently, a cardiac source of emboli.
