Clinical diagnostic considerations on cocaine abuse.
 Following a review of the research literature on the psychophysiological effects of cocaine, a study is described of a group of 120 cocaine addicts.
 Of the 120 patients, 10 (8.33%) exhibited fleeting, unformed, organic delusions and hallucinations.
 Case reports of the 10 cases are presented.
 The quality of the adverse subjective effects of cocaine is emphasized, and the differential diagnosis between Cocaine Delusional Disorder and Paranoid Schizophrenia is discussed.
 Guidelines for a more accurate differential diagnosis are provided.
