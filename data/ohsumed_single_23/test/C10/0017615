Ataxia and peripheral neuropathy: a benign variant of peroxisome dysgenesis.
 A 5-year-old boy with panperoxisomal dysfunction is described.
 Clinical features included hypotonia, areflexia, and ataxia.
 Cognition, vision, hearing, and hepatic function were normal.
 A panel of peroxisomal markers, including very-long-chain fatty acids, phytanic acid, pipecolic acid, and catalase compartmentalization, were abnormal.
 This is a uniquely benign syndrome of disordered peroxisome biogenesis.
