Spinal man after declaration of brain death 
 Complex spinal automatism in a patient who was declared brain dead is described.
 These movements tend to appear once cerebrospinal shock has abated.
 We postulate that these manifestations are a reflection of the physiological potential of the isolated spinal cord.
 These spinal movements should be included in the revised guidelines for the determination of cerebral death.
