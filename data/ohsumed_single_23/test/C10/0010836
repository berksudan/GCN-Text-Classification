Effect of nimodipine on acute ischemic stroke. Pooled results from five randomized trials.
 In a review of pooled data from five double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of nimodipine in acute ischemic stroke, we compared the effect of 120 mg nimodipine given orally with that of placebo.
 In the five studies, 871 patients were followed, and 781 adhered to entry and inclusion criteria.
 End points were mortality and outcome at the end of the treatment period (21 or 28 days).
 Outcome was assessed with Mathew's scale and the physician's clinical judgement.
 The treatment and control groups were well matched with respect to demographic data, risk factors, and baseline Mathew scores.
 In the treatment group, 34 patients (7.9%) died during the treatment period, whereas 54 (12.3%) in the control group died, corresponding with a mortality reduction of 36%.
 Significantly less neurologic impairment at the end of the treatment period was documented under nimodipine treatment, and this impairment improved more in patients with moderate-to-severe stroke (baseline Mathew score less than 66) if administration of nimodipine occurred within 12 hours after stroke onset or if the patient was more than 65 years old.
 The overall incidence of adverse reactions was relatively modest, and these were of minor severity; only a few appeared to have more than a remote relation to the study medication.
