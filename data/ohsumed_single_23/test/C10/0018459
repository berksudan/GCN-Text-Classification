Neurologic status of spina bifida patients and the orthopedic surgeon.
 The purpose of this paper is to review recent developments in the neurologic assessment of spina bifida patients.
 Determination of the neurosegmental level of the lesion, recognition of spasticity and progressive paralysis, the potential for deformity, and functional expectations are described.
 The status of the neurologic deficit remains the most important factor in determining the myelomeningocele patient's ultimate functional abilities.
 Accurate neurologic assessment will assist in meeting the aims of orthopedic management, which include preventing joint contracture, correcting deformity, preventing skin sores, and obtaining the best possible locomotor function.
