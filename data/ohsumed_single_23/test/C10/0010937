Impairment of sequences of memory-guided saccades after supplementary motor area lesions.
 Different paradigms of saccades were recorded electro-oculographically in 2 patients with infarction affecting the left supplementary motor area.
 Saccades made toward visual targets (visually-guided saccades) or away from them (antisaccades) were normal in both patients.
 Memory-guided saccades, made to the remembered position of a flash occurring 2 seconds before, were preserved in 1 patient and only slightly impaired in the other.
 However, sequences of two or three memory-guided saccades were severely impaired in both patients.
 It has previously been reported that the supplementary motor area plays an important role in programming sequential limb movements.
 Our data suggest that this area plays a similar role in the control of sequential eye movements.
