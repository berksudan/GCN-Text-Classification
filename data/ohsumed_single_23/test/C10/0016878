Frontal impairment and hypoperfusion in neuroacanthocytosis.
 Cerebral blood flow tomography, by xenon 133 inhalation or HMPAO (99mTc-d, l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime) technetium Tc 99m injection, revealed a severe hypoperfusion in both frontal lobes of a 40-year-old woman with confirmed neuroacanthocytosis.
 This finding occurred in conjunction with neuropsychological deficits consistent with selective frontal lobe dysfunction.
 This observation is the first documentation of this type of dementia in neuroacanthocytosis.
