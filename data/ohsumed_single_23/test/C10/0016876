An early description of slowly progressive aphasia.
 Slowly progressive aphasia without generalized dementia has become an important issue of present-day neuropsychological research.
 Historically, credit for the first description is usually given to Pick.
 Another German-speaking author who has published a vivid description of a pertinent cases is Pick's contemporary, Max Rosenfeld.
 This author has also observed a patient with slowly progressive spatial disorientation and visual recognition deficit, and he has discussed these patients in a remarkably modern way in the context of partial atrophy of the brain.
