Transcranial Doppler in acute hemispheric brain infarction.
 We studied cerebrovascular anatomy using intra-arterial digital angiography, and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography in 42 patients with acute hemispheric ischemic brain infarction.
 We compared angiography with TCD and the clinical findings within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms.
 The location and extent of the chronic ischemic brain damage was assessed by CT performed 1 to 3 months after the ictus.
 Abnormal TCD, as manifested by either an unobtainable MCA flow signal or a significantly depressed MCA flow velocity, was highly associated with proximal MCA occlusions demonstrated by angiography.
 Abnormal TCD predicted both larger chronic CT lesions and more extensive ischemic change within the MCA territory.
 These data demonstrate that early TCD conveys useful information concerning cerebral tissue prognosis following hemispheric ischemia.
