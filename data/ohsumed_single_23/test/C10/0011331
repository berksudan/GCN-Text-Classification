Contingent Negative Variation in migraine.
 The Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) is an event-related slow potential.
 It was recorded in healthy volunteers (n = 8) and in patients suffering from migraine without (n = 12) or with (n = 5) aura, during one (CNV1) and three second (CNV3) foreperiods in a forewarned reaction time task.
 CNV1 was recorded at the vertex while CNV3 was recorded at multiple electrode sites to assess topographical differences.
 Seven out of twelve migraine patients without aura had increased CNV1 amplitudes.
 CNV3 amplitudes were increased as well, but only at electrode positions C3 and C4 and not at Fz.
 CNV3, which allows for analysis of both an early and a late CNV component, could improve the discrimination of migraine without aura beyond that of CNV1.
 In migraine with aura all CNV parameters were at control levels, confirming previous results.
 The data obtained are discussed in terms of arousal, activation and stress and the "biobehavioral model of migraine" (Welch, 1986).
