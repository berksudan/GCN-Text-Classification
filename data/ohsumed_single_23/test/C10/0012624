Oestrogen and progesterone receptors in acoustic neuroma.
 Tissue samples from fourteen consecutive (8 male: 6 female) acoustic neuromas were assayed for hormone receptors using either a monoclonal antibody (MA), dextran coated charcoal (DCC) or isoelectric focusing (IEF) technique.
 In this series there were no unequivocally positive results, a finding at variance with previously published results.
