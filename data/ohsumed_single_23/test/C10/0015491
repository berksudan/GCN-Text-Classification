The disabled driver: an unmet challenge.
 A survey was undertaken to determine if driving impairment secondary to a disabling injury is addressed in state licensing laws and training programs.
 In 35 states drivers submit voluntarily to reevaluation after disabling injuries, but no provision is made for reporting such individuals.
 Only 15 states authorize physicians to report impaired drivers, and only seven require such reporting.
 Based on a survey of licensing bureaus in the capital or a major city of every state, clerks (who are likely to be the source of information to injured persons) are generally not aware of reporting requirements and supervisors are only slightly better informed.
 Of the 100 rehabilitation centers surveyed, only 36 provided on-site training for disabled drivers.
 Voluntary submission for reevaluation after head injury does not often occur.
 Despite being asked to do so, none of the 35 head injured patients, followed up to two years post-onset, sought reevaluation, although 21 had resumed regular driving.
 Two of the 21 were involved in subsequent traffic accidents.
 Common guidelines need to be established across states to ensure reevaluation of individuals with disabling conditions, delivery of accurate information concerning licensing, and availability of training programs.
