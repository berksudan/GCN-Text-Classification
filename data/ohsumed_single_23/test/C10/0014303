Cerebral palsy and rhizotomy. A 3-year follow-up evaluation with gait analysis.
 A recent increase in the popularity of selective rhizotomy for reduction of spasticity in cerebral palsy has led to a demand for more objective studies of outcome and long-term follow-up results.
 The authors present the results of gait analysis on 14 children with spastic cerebral palsy, who underwent selective posterior rhizotomy in 1985.
 Sagittal plane gait patterns were studied before surgery and at 1 and 3 years after surgery using a digital camera system.
 The parameters measured included the range of motion at the knee and thigh, stride length, speed of walking, and cadence.
 The range of motion at the knee was significantly increased at 1 year after surgery and further improved to a nearly normal range at 3 years after surgery.
 In contrast, postoperative measurements of thigh range exceeded normal values at 1 year, but decreased toward normal range at 3 years.
 While improvements in range of motion continued between Years 1 and 3, the children developed a more extended thigh and knee position, which indicated a more upright walking posture.
 Stride length and speed of walking also improved, while cadence remained essentially unchanged.
 This 3-year follow-up study, the first to examine rhizotomy using an objective approach, has provided some encouraging results regarding early functional outcome.
