Modifying the translabyrinthine approach to preserve hearing during acoustic tumour surgery.
 Removing an acoustic schwannoma using the translabyrinthine approach has previously been considered incompatible with hearing preservation.
 By modifying the approach and preventing the loss of endolymph, we have successfully removed an intracanalicular acoustic schwannoma, which originated from the inferior vestibular nerve, and preserved hearing in the operated ear.
 This report represents the preliminary findings using this particular technique in the management of an intracanalicular acoustic tumour.
