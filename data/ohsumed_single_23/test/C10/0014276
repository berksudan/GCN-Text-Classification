The development of infratentorial atrophy in patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia of late onset: a CT study.
 The development of infratentorial atrophy in six patients suffering from idiopathic cerebellar ataxia of late onset was studied by a retrospective evaluation of consecutive computed tomography (CT) scans.
 Four patients had evidence of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) both on clinical testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
 In these four patients, atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem became visible at the same time and progressed in a roughly parallel manner, whereas in the remaining two the brain stem was left intact.
 In all patients with OPCA, definite brain-stem atrophy was visible earlier than the appearance of non-cerebellar clinical symptoms.
 The present data suggest that CT investigations at regular intervals may be of prognostic value in cerebellar ataxias.
