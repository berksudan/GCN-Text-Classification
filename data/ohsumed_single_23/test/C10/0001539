The molecular biology of occlusive stroke in childhood.
 It is very likely that many of the same factors involved in occlusive disease in the adult are operative in the child.
 The major difference may be in the factors that damage endothelium in these two age groups and thereby initiate this catastrophe (atherosclerosis versus "other" causes of endothelial changes).
 Our task in this next decade is the rational exploration of the effects of endothelium-mediated kinins, endothelial secretory products, angiospasm, platelet aggregration, prostaglandins, and lipoproteins on pediatric stroke.
