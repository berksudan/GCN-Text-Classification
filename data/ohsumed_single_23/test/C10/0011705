Suppression of carbamazepine-induced rash with prednisone.
 We report our experience with 20 patients who developed a rash shortly after the introduction of carbamazepine and were treated with prednisone and an antihistamine.
 Sixteen patients were successfully continued on carbamazepine while 4 had to discontinue the drug.
