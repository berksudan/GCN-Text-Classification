Tension pneumocephalus: treatment with controlled decompression via a closed water-seal drainage system. Case report.
 The successful treatment of a patient with tension pneumocephalus by controlled decompression via external drainage is described.
 The advantage of the technique includes the immediate release of high pressure and the capability of maintaining constant low pressure to enable and facilitate sealing of dural tears.
 The method has been used in three other patients, leading to resolution of the tension pneumocephalus without recurrence or other complications.
