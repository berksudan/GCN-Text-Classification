Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in state mental hospitals: data from a nationwide survey.
 Notwithstanding three decades of transferring of the elderly to nursing homes, geriatric patients continue to reside in state mental hospitals.
 Many of these patients, perhaps one-third or more, are thought to suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD).
 This study reports data from a nationwide survey of state hospitals that provides an exploratory look at the ADRD patients currently served in state hospitals.
 Admission trends, reasons for admission, and sources of referral are described.
 Civil commitment of nursing home patients with dementing illnesses and the place of the state hospital in the continuum of care for ADRD patients are discussed.
