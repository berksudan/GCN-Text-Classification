Antiepileptic drugs, cognitive function, and behavior in children: evidence from recent studies.
 The effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on cognitive function and behavior in children are reviewed on the basis of published studies.
 Individual AEDs have been shown to differ--the deleterious effects of phenytoin generally contrasting with the relatively minimal effects of valproate and carbamazepine.
 Some of the differences between results may be attributed to the psychological tests used and to age differences.
 However, there appears to be a dissociation between AEDs that affect higher cognitive function, e.g., phenytoin, and those mainly affecting motor function, e.g., carbamazepine, which appears to increase speed of performance, AEDs should be prescribed with care in children with epilepsy, taking account of their differing effects on cognitive function and behavior.
