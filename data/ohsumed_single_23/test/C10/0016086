The timed "Up & Go": a test of basic functional mobility for frail elderly persons.
 This study evaluated a modified, timed version of the "Get-Up and Go" Test (Mathias et al, 1986) in 60 patients referred to a Geriatric Day Hospital (mean age 79.5 years).
 The patient is observed and timed while he rises from an arm chair, walks 3 meters, turns, walks back, and sits down again.
 The results indicate that the time score is (1) reliable (inter-rater and intra-rater); (2) correlates well with log-transformed scores on the Berg Balance Scale (r = -0.81), gait speed (r = -0.61) and Barthel Index of ADL (r = -0.78); and (3) appears to predict the patient's ability to go outside alone safely.
 These data suggest that the timed "Up & Go" test is a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility that may also be useful in following clinical change over time.
 The test is quick, requires no special equipment or training, and is easily included as part of the routine medical examination.
