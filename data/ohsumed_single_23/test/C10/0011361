Effects of carotid denervation and decerebration on ventilatory response to CO.
 To clarify the mechanisms involved in the ventilatory response to the inhalation of low concentrations of CO (0.18-0.22% in air), the roles of the arterial chemoreceptors and the forebrain structures have been investigated in unanesthetized adult cats.
 The ventilatory response was observed in conscious animals intact, after carotid denervation (CD), and after midcollicular decerebration.
 The results show that the initial small ventilatory depression was unaffected by CD but that the subsequent characteristic tachypnea was blunted after CD even after more prolonged exposure to CO.
 The CO tachypnea was not observed after decerebration, but a residual hyperventilation was noted with the higher concentration used.
 It may be concluded that carotid chemoreceptors do not mediate the CO tachypnea, which may then originate in suprapontine structures as shown by comparison of intact and decerebrate animals.
 The blunting of the tachypnea after CD may be caused by the relative hypercapnia observed in CD animals.
 The residual hyperventilation observed in decerebrate animals may be caused by central acidosis and/or some peripheral potentiation of chemoreceptor activity resulting from the decrease in arterial blood pressure that accompanied CO inhalation in decerebrate animals.
