Treatment of fulminant hepatic failure with insulin and glucagon. A randomized, controlled trial.
 Insulin and glucagon are among the therapeutic modalities that have been investigated in the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF).
 We have completed a randomized, controlled trial of insulin and glucagon in 38 patients with FHF from either viral or toxin exposure.
 The control and treatment groups consisted of 21 and 17 patients, respectively, and did not differ significantly in etiology or admission laboratory values.
 Mortality was not significantly different between control and treatment groups and was 67% and 82%, respectively.
 Time from randomization to death or discharge was not significantly different between the two groups.
 Peak levels of alpha-fetoprotein were statistically higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors (P less than 0.01).
 We conclude that even though a type-2 error may exist, the combination of insulin and glucagon is not useful in the treatment of FHF.
