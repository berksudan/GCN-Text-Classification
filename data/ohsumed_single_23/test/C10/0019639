Pain management in the orthopedic patient.
 Pain is a familiar phenomenon to all orthopedic nurses.
 As Dunwoody said, "Few things we do for patients are more fundamental to the quality of life than relieving pain." We as orthopedic nurses are in a position to contribute to the positive management of pain by using a comprehensive approach to pain management that involves the participation of the patient.
 We need to believe the patient's pain, try new approaches, and help our patients achieve pain relief.
