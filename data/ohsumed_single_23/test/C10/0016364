Comparison of functional and structural brain disturbances in Wilson's disease.
 We assessed the functional and structural brain disturbances in Wilson's disease (WD) by evoked potentials (EPs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
 All the 25 neurologically symptomatic and 44% of the 16 asymptomatic patients, assessed by both EPs (n = 48) and imaging (n = 41), had at least 1 abnormality of either prolonged EP conduction times, imaging-outlined presence of cerebral lesions, or brain atrophy.
 Our findings indicate that EPs and MRI are sensitive techniques for the evaluation of brain involvement in WD.
