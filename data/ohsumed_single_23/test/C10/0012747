The management of mid-face fractures with intracranial injury.
 Recent advances have radically changed the management of facial fractures.
 CT scanning, extensive exposure, and rigid plate fixation in the setting of the trauma center have permitted early operation with improved results.
 A subset of patients with facial fractures will also have intracranial injuries (ICI).
 We sought to identify parameters associated with an increased risk for ICI.
 We also sought to examine the safety and limits of early craniofacial repair in patients with intracranial injuries.
 Of 114 mid-face fractures treated over a 1-year period, 43 (38%) had a concomitant ICI.
 The majority, 36 (84%), were from motor vehicle accidents (MVA).
 Frontal sinus and orbitoethmoid fractures were at the highest risk for ICI, although orbitozygomatic fractures caused by MVAs also had a surprisingly high incidence of ICI.
 Our results show that early craniofacial repair can be performed safely with appropriate general surgical and neurosurgical support.
