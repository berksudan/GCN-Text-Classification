Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders. Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment.
 In this report, we discuss the definition, characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatment of tic disorders with a major emphasis on Tourette syndrome.
 Although the diagnosis of a tic disorder depends on the presence of motor and/or phonic tic(s), patients with these problems also have a variety of co-morbid features including obsessive-compulsive symptoms, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, behavioral difficulties, and learning disabilities.
 Conservative estimates for Tourette syndrome suggest a prevalence rate of 0.1-1.0 per 1000.
 This syndrome is inherited in a sex-influenced autosomal dominant pattern with either chronic multiple tic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder as alternative phenotypes of the putative gene.
 Current evidence continues to support a pathophysiologic mechanism involving synaptic neurotransmission, with the dopaminergic system as a primary candidate.
 Therapeutically, it is essential to clarify whether a patient's problems are related to tics or associated behavioral difficulties.
 Pharmacotherapy for motor and phonic tics is strictly symptomatic and should be reserved for those with functionally disabling symptoms.
 A comprehensive individualized treatment program is often required in the care of individuals with tic disorders.
