Arterial responses during migraine headache.
 The superficial temporal artery has been thought to be the main focus of pain during migraine attacks, but its diameter has never been measured directly.
 The use of a new, high-resolution ultrasound machine to measure arterial size in 25 migraine patients with unilateral head pain showed that the lumen was wider on the painful than on the non-painful side during a migraine attack.
 The diameters of both radial arteries and the temporal artery on the non-painful side were smaller during than between attacks.
 The generalised vasoconstriction was not shared by the temporal artery on the affected side, which suggests a local vasodilatory response.
 The findings suggest that cephalic arteries may play a role in migraine pathogenesis.
