Manifestations of migraine.
 Migraine is a disorder with multiple manifestations affecting the circulation, gastrointestinal tract, and the central nervous system.
 Involvement of the autonomic nervous system is responsible for many of the clinical features.
 An attack of migraine can vary from a fragment of the clinical spectrum to one with several phases and potentially permanent sequelae.
