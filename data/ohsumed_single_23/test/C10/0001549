Rehabilitation of the pediatric patient with a neuromuscular disease.
 A rehabilitation program for a patient with a neuromuscular disease can be developed only after an accurate diagnosis has been established.
 The diagnosis and its ramifications should suggest a natural course of disease which, it is hoped, can be improved upon with a rational and realistic program.
 The program is best developed by an interdisciplinary team, including a pediatric neurologist, who should have the greatest understanding of the patient's problem and should ultimately be responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the program.
 A child with cerebral palsy commonly requires the services of physical and occupational therapists as well as knowledgeable orthopedists.
 Is the program appropriate? Does it consider the child's potential as well as his limitations? A child with a traumatic brain injury requires, in addition to the above, psychological intervention and an intensive educational program.
 Will the child and family need help from mental health professionals? A child with a motor unit disease such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy requires, in addition to the above services, a "philosophy" of care.
 Will the child ever ambulate independently? If so, at what cost? What will be necessary for the child to reach this potential, including items such as orthoses and adaptive equipment? Will respirator care become necessary? What issues must be addressed for this form of care to be established? There is no one program for all children.
 The programs must be individualized to meet the needs of the patient and the family.
 This point cannot be overemphasized.
