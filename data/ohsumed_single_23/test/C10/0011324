Analgesic use: a study of treatments used by patients for migraine prior to attending the City of London Migraine Clinic.
 Eighty-three unselected patients attending the City of London Migraine Clinic for the first time were asked about their drug intake and use of alternative treatment.
 Thirty-one of those questioned took regular daily doses of medication.
 Fifteen were taking a combination of drugs bought 'over the counter' (OTC) and drugs prescribed by their GP; eleven took OTC drugs only; and 5 took prescription drugs only.
 It was noticeable that those taking drugs prescribed both by the GP and obtainable over the counter were more likely than the other groups to be taking several drugs rather than a single type.
 Thirty five of the 83 (42.2%) had tried alternative treatments for their attacks.
