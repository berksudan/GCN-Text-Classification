Relaxation training in school classes does not reduce headache complaints.
 The effect of teacher-presented Progressive Relaxation Training (PRT) on headaches, fear of failure and school problems was studied in school students.
 During ten physical education lessons, students received either PRT (n = 110) or placebo training (n = 92).
 The effect of the training was investigated in students who indicated the presence of headaches in a pre-training diary.
 No significant differences were found between both training groups regarding headache frequency, duration and intensity and the psychological variables.
 On the basis of these and previous findings, it is recommended to present PRT to fairly small groups of self-selected subjects instead of complete classes.
