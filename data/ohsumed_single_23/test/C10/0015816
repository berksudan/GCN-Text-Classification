Discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in children who have outgrown epilepsy: effects on cognitive function.
 Cognitive function is frequently impaired in children with epilepsy, compared with age-matched controls.
 It can be hard to evaluate the significance of various contributory factors.
 The effects of antiepileptic drugs may be studied in children who have outgrown their epilepsy but are still being treated.
 A multicenter study to assess various aspects of cognitive function in children with different forms of epilepsy, both during and after treatment with antiepileptic drugs, is currently under way.
 Definitive results are not yet available; interim analysis of the findings suggests that short-term memory is decreased in all subgroups of children being treated for epilepsy, compared to controls.
