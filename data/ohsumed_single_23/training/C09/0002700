Comparison of propofol and thiopental/halothane for short-duration ENT surgical procedures in children.
 Experiences with propofol in pediatric anesthesia are limited.
 We undertook a study to evaluate the quality of induction and recovery from anesthesia with propofol compared to thiopental/halothane.
 Twenty children received 3 mg.kg-1.min-1 of propofol as a loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1 (+/- 10%).
 Twenty children received 5-7 mg/kg of thiopental, and maintenance was provided with halothane (0.5%-1.5%).
 The interval between the end of the administration of propofol or thiopental/halothane and extubation, as well to discharge to the ward, was significantly shorter with propofol (4.4 versus 13.5 min and 7.22 versus 30.4 min, respectively).
 Spontaneous movements and pain on injection were seen significantly more frequently with propofol, whereas laryngospasm and hiccup were only observed with thiopental.
 During the first 6 h after the surgical procedure, analgesics were needed significantly more often in the thiopental group.
 Nausea and vomiting also were observed more frequently in the thiopental group.
 In conclusion, propofol used as a single anesthetic is a satisfactory technique for ENT surgery of short duration in children.
