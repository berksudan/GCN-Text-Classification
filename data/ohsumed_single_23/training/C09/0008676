The efficacy of oral steroids in the treatment of persistent otitis media with effusion.
 One hundred thirty-six children with otitis media with effusion of at least 2 months' duration were investigated in a strict, double-blind, randomized prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of oral steroids in the treatment of this disease.
 The results of our study showed a significant complete and partial recovery from otitis media with effusion in the group treated by a combination of antibiotics (amoxicillin) and oral steroids (prednisone), compared with an amoxicillin-treated group and a placebo-treated group.
 We believe that this treatment mostly benefits children aged 4 to 10 years without oversized adenoids.
 The findings of our study imply that a combined course of antibiotics and oral steroids deserves its place as a routine conservative trial before surgery.
