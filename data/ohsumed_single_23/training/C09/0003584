Hearing aids for high-frequency hearing loss.
 This cross-over study compares the relative benefits of a standard NHS contracted hearing aid with a high-frequency emphasis commercial aid in subjects with high-frequency hearing loss.
 Disability questionnaires and free-field speech-in-noise (FAAF II) tests were used to assess subjects unaided and after 6 weeks of wearing each aid.
 Total FAAF II test scores showed no significant difference with either aid, but analysis of frequency-specific subscores demonstrated less use of low-frequency information when using the high-frequency emphasis aid.
 Overall questionnaire responses relating to conversation showed more benefit with the high-frequency emphasis aid.
 Subjects generally preferred this aid, possibly due to less low-tone gain than the standard NHS aid.
