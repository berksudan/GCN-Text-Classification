Selective management of early glottic cancer.
 Seventy patients with stage I and II glottic cancer were treated at the University of Utah School of Medicine hospitals from 1980 through 1987.
 Forty-four patients had stage I cancer and 26 patients had stage II.
 The overall survival in the stage I group was 82%.
 Primary site control was 93% with only three deaths due to laryngeal cancer.
 Local control rates were 93% with CO2 laser excision, 80% with CO2 laser and irradiation, and 67% with radiation alone.
 Stage II glottic patients had an overall survival of 61.5% with a local control rate of 76%.
 Twenty-one of 24 patients were treated by full-course irradiation.
 Of the eight patients who recurred at the primary site, all were irradiation failures who had initial bulky disease and impaired vocal cord mobility.
 Selective CO2 laser excision was highly effective, whereas radiation therapy results were somewhat disappointing.
 Open partial laryngectomy should be considered in bulky stage II disease patients.
