Vocal cord paralysis in children.
 Bilateral vocal cord paralysis is a common cause of stridor in infants and children.
 There are significant differences in this entity between children and adults with regard to etiology, diagnosis, management, and outcome.
 A review of 10 years' experience at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia identified 51 children seen with the diagnosis of vocal cord paralysis.
 These cases were evaluated with respect to etiology of paralysis, whether unilateral or bilateral, delay in diagnosis, need for tracheotomy, abnormality of voice, surgical treatment, and outcome.
 Guidelines for management for a child with vocal cord paralysis are presented with emphasis on flexible endoscopic evaluation and conservative management.
