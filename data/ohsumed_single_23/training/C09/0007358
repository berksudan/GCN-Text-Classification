Chondrogenic potential of tragal perichondrium: a cause of hearing loss following stapedectomy.
 Tragal perichondrium is a widely used tissue seal in the oval window following stapes surgery.
 Autogenous and easily accessible, it is a suitable substance to cover the vestibule in total stapedectomy, and to seal around the prosthesis in small-fenestra stapedotomy.
 The incidence of complications from the use of perichondrium in this manner is exceedingly low.
 We report a case where tragal perichondrium in the oval window resulted in the proliferation of cartilage.
 The cartilage displaced the stapes prosthesis, resulting in a conductive loss.
 Although the chondrogenic potential of perichondrium is known, we are not aware of other reports implicating this as a cause of failure in stapes surgery.
 The pertinent clinical and experimental literature regarding chondrogenesis is reviewed.
 This information suggests that the formation of cartilage from perichondrium in the oval window might be influenced by mechanical trauma and tissue orientation.
