Ligmaject system for local anaesthesia in otology.
 The Ligmaject syringe for local anaesthetic injection incorporates a pistol-grip handle and a ratchet system designed to inject a very tiny aliquot of anaesthetic per 'click'.
 This instrument was used to provide local anaesthesia for 22 otological procedures on consenting adults.
 The performance of the Ligmaject syringe compared favourably with that of the conventional dental syringe in terms of patient acceptability and user convenience.
