Informed consent in head and neck surgery.
 Informed consent is the fastest growing problem in the medical negligence debate.
 It was highlighted recently in the United Kingdom in the Sidaway case.
 Informed consent comprises the advice you would give the patient, the consequences of not taking your advice, the specific risks of the surgery or treatment you have in mind, and the risks of surgery in general.
 In an attempt to identify what the present practice in otolaryngology was, a postal survey was carried out of the members of the Scottish and North of England Otolaryngological Societies.
