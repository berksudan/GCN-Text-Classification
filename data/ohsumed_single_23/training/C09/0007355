Small fenestra stapedotomy using a fiberoptic hand-held argon laser in obliterative otosclerosis.
 Obliterative otosclerosis has been a challenge since the advent of stapes surgery.
 "Drill-out" procedures have had a generally poorer prognosis than conventional stapes surgery because of excessive bleeding, acoustic trauma from the burr, and reclosure of the oval window by otosclerosis.
 In this report, we describe our early experience using a hand-held fiberoptic argon laser for small fenestra stapedotomy in 10 cases of obliterative otosclerosis.
 Closure of the air-bone gap to within 10 dB was seen in 100% of the patients.
 There was no significant sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, or facial weakness.
 Argon-laser stapedotomy using a hand-held fiberoptic system is a safe and effective alternative to drill-out stapedotomy in cases of obliterative otosclerosis.
