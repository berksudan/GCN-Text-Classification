Short term treatment of acromegaly with the somatostatin analog octreotide: the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study on its effects.
 Several studies suggest that the somatostatin analog octreotide, or SMS 201-995, may effectively reduce GH hypersecretion.
 However, no double blind, placebo-controlled study has substantiated these findings.
 We present the results of a randomized double blind 14-day clinical trial with octreotide in 20 patients with acromegaly.
 The drug was given sc every 8 h and to the initial dose (50 micrograms) was added another 50 micrograms every other day up to 200 micrograms.
 GH levels, calculated as the mean values of 12 observations at hourly intervals during 0700-1800 h, and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels were significantly reduced during octreotide treatment.
 Responses varied from a reduction of 97% of the basal mean GH level to no significant reduction in 2 of 10 patients.
 There was a good correlation between the reduction of GH and IGF-I levels.
 The main side-effects were gastrointestinal and well tolerated.
 We found a spontaneous variation of daily mean GH and IGF-I levels (at 0700 h) in the placebo group, ranging from approximately 150% to 50% of the GH and 120% to 80% of the IGF-I levels noted on day 0.
 In patients treated with octreotide, the occurrence of GH rises between administration times suggests that it may be desirable to give octreotide every 6 h in some patients.
