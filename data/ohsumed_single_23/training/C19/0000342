Tests of thyroid function: update in the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease.
 Current thyroid function tests give the clinician powerful tools for the accurate assessment of thyroid status in the majority of patients encountered.
 There are, however, a small number of clinical situations in which there appear to be inconsistencies in the interrelationship of the thyroid function tests and/or in which they are apparently inappropriate to the clinical status of the patient.
 In most instances, there is a rational explanation for these observed alterations.
 The application of this information should allow clinicians to further refine their diagnostic accuracy and thereby enable them to proceed with an appropriate therapeutic or management program.
