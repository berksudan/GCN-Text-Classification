Training obstetrics-and-gynecology residents to manage breast disease. Incorporation into a breast care clinic.
 The American Board of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently issued a directive that education in breast disease be incorporated into all residency training programs.
 At the University of Michigan Medical Center, the Comprehensive Breast Care Center (BCC) provides the vehicle for the education and training of residents in the area of breast disease.
 The department of obstetrics and gynecology is fully integrated and participates actively in the care of patients in the BCC.
