Lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels in subclinical hypothyroidism. Effect of levothyroxine therapy.
 To assess whether subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with changes in lipoprotein fractions, 13 patients maintained in a stable state of subclinical hypothyroidism for at least 3 months were studied prior to and 2 and 4 months following restoration of a euthyroid state with incremental levothyroxine sodium therapy.
 Thyrotropin levels ( +/- SEM) had decreased from 16.6 +/- 3.2 mU/L to 3.1 +/- 0.7 mU/L and 3.2 +/- 0.7 mU/L at 2 months and 4 months.
 At 2 months, levothyroxine treatment led to a decrease in levels of total cholesterol from 5.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (213 +/- 12 mg/dL) to 4.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (186 +/- 12 mg/dL), in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from 3.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (143 +/- 12 mg/dL) to 2.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (112 +/- 12 mg/dL), and in apolipoprotein B from 91 +/- 8 mg/dL to 74 +/- 7 mg/dL.
 At 4 months, levels of LDL-C and apolipoprotein B remained significantly lower than pretreatment values (2.9 +/- 0.2 mmol/L [112 +/- 8 mg/dL] and 75 +/- 6 mg/dL, respectively).
 While high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL3-C, and apolipoprotein A-I were not significantly affected by levothyroxine therapy, there was a slight trend of increase in HDL2-C during levothyroxine substitution.
 There was also a tendency for a decrease in triglyceride levels from 1.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/L (115 +/- 18 mg/dL) to 0.9 +/- 0.1 mmol/L (80 +/- 9 mg/dL) at 4 months of levothyroxine therapy.
 Levels of HDL-C tended to decrease from 4.8 +/- 0.4 mmol/L (186 +/- 15 mg/dL) to 4.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (174 +/- 19 mg/dL) at 2 months and to 3.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/L (151 +/- 15 mg/dL) at 4 months.
 The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio also decreased from 3.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (128 +/- 12 mg/dL) to 2.9 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (112 +/- 19 mg/dL) and 2.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (97 +/- 12 mg/dL) at 2 months and 4 months, respectively.
 These results suggest that long-term levothyroxine therapy in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with a decrease in LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels that are reflected in a trend of decreases in cholesterol/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios known to have a relationship with coronary artery disease.
