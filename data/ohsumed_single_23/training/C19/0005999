Prevalence of previously undiagnosed hypothyroidism in residents of a midwestern nursing home [published erratum appears in South Med J 1991 Jul;84(7):936]
 Hypothyroidism in the elderly may be associated with nonspecific symptoms.
 To determine the prevalence of undiagnosed hypothyroidism in residents of a skilled nursing facility, we screened 434 male and 137 female residents, aged 60 years or older, for thyroid dysfunction.
 Overt hypothyroidism was found in three men and two women.
 Subclinical hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 42 men (9.7%) and 20 women (14.6%).
 Tests for thyroid antibodies were positive in all patients with overt hypothyroidism and in 12 (34%) of the 35 men and 12 (67%) of the 18 women with subclinical hypothyroidism who had thyroid antibody testing.
 All residents with newly diagnosed overt hypothyroidism and 54 (87%) of the 62 with subclinical hypothyroidism had been under medical observation for 1 year or longer.
 The institutionalized elderly should be screened for hypothyroidism because this abnormality may otherwise remain undiagnosed.
 The detection of subclinical hypothyroidism is important, as affected individuals are at risk for further decline in thyroid function.
