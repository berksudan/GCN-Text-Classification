Treating diabetes in the elderly. What are the special considerations?
 Management of diabetes in elderly patients generally follows the same lines as in younger patients; that is, improvement of blood glucose status with diet, oral hypoglycemic, and insulin therapy as required.
 Older patients are more fragile, however, and more caution must be used with therapeutic interventions.
