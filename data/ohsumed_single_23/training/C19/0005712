Aberrant splicing of androgen receptor mRNA results in synthesis of a nonfunctional receptor protein in a patient with androgen insensitivity.
 Androgen insensitivity is a disorder in which the correct androgen response in an androgen target cell is impaired.
 The clinical symptoms of this X chromosome-linked syndrome are presumed to be caused by mutations in the androgen receptor gene.
 We report a G----T mutation in the splice donor site of intron 4 of the androgen receptor gene of a 46,XY subject lacking detectable androgen binding to the receptor and with the complete form of androgen insensitivity.
 This point mutation completely abolishes normal RNA splicing at the exon 4/intron 4 boundary and results in the activation of a cryptic splice donor site in exon 4, which leads to the deletion of 123 nucleotides from the mRNA.
 Translation of the mutant mRNA results in an androgen receptor protein approximately 5 kDa smaller than the wild type.
 This mutated androgen receptor protein was unable to bind androgens and unable to activate transcription of an androgen-regulated reporter gene construct.
 This mutation in the human androgen receptor gene demonstrates the importance of an intact steroid-binding domain for proper androgen receptor functioning in vivo.
