Cold follicles in a multinodular human goiter arise partly from a failing iodide pump and partly from deficient iodine organification.
 To investigate whether the common cold follicles in human multinodular goiters are the consequence of a functional defect of the apical membrane peroxidase, a failure of the iodide transport system, or both deficiencies, we studied iodide accumulation and iodine organification in 30 fragments of a large multinodular goiter transplanted to nude mice and labeled with 125I.
 Transplants were frozen to -80 C immediately after removal to avoid diffusion of inorganic iodide.
 Autoradiographic assessment of over 1000 cryosections (exposed either at -20 C or after thawing and washing out unbound iodide) showed two types of cold follicles, namely those that failed to accumulate iodide and, therefore, did not organify iodine, and those that readily accumulated iodide but failed to bind it, suggesting a failure of apical membrane peroxidase.
 The two types of pathogenetically different cold follicles coexisted in an apparently randomly intermingled fashion throughout the whole goiter.
