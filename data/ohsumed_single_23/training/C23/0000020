Tissue expansion of the head and neck. Indications, technique, and complications.
 Tissue expansion is indicated in the reconstruction of various defects of the head and neck in instances where there is inadequate adjacent tissue to allow either primary closure of the defect or repair with a local flap.
 It may also be indicated in instances where repair of a defect by an alternative method such as a local, regional, or distant flap will result in an unacceptable donor or recipient site deformity.
 Although tissue expansion is simplistic in concept, it does require judgment and indepth preoperative planning to ensure optimal results.
 The complication rate is high for tissue expansion in the head and neck, particularly in the cheek and neck area.
 Despite the frequency of complications, in the vast majority of cases the intended reconstruction is successful.
