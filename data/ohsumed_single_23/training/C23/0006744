An objective appraisal of the role of computed tomographic (CT) guided drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses.
 Computed tomographic (CT) guided drainage is an important tool in the treatment of intra-abdominal abscess.
 Its most important role is in the treatment of small, unilocular, well-placed abscesses.
 Success rates in our experience diminish considerably in abscesses involving necrotic tumors or those infected with yeast.
 As is frequently characteristic of new technologic procedures, the initial evaluation of the success rate of the procedure is overly optimistic.
 The procedure carries a considerable complication rate (13%) and mortality rate (15%).
 Most importantly, success is usually evident early; within the first 24 to 48 hours.
 After this length of time, careful evaluation to consider further treatment should be contemplated.
