Intravenous fluid load and recovery. A double-blind comparison in gynaecological patients who had day-case laparoscopy.
 The effect of intra-operative fluid and dextrose administration upon recovery was tested in a randomised, double-blind trial.
 Three groups of 25 patients, each undergoing laparoscopic examination as day cases, were studied.
 The two groups who received fluid (20 ml/kg compound sodium lactate solution) showed significant improvement (p less than 0.05) in the variables that reflected hydration.
 The fluid group who also received dextrose (1 g/kg) exhibited further significant improvement.
 Intra-operative fluid and dextrose administration appears to confer some benefit upon recovery in patients who have minor surgery.
