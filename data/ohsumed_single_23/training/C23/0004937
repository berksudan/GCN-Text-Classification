Facial muscle reanimation using the trigeminal motor nerve: an experimental study in the rabbit.
 Surgical repair of facial nerve deficits may be marred by lack of muscle control and donor region paresis.
 Using New Zealand white rabbits, a study was undertaken to evaluate facial muscle reanimation with a donor source not previously used: the motor division of the trigeminal nerve.
 The results were compared with the severed facial nerve and hypoglossal-facial coaptation.
 An atrophy scale was calibrated for facial muscles of the rabbit.
 Clinical, electromyographic, and histomorphometric findings confirmed that the trigeminal nerve was a suitable donor source.
 The neurorrhaphy produced an exponential rate of repair.
