Vitamin B6 in the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome--a review [published erratum appears in Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1991 Mar;98(3):329-30] 
 A search of the literature yielded 12 controlled trials on vitamin B6 in the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome.
 These are discussed with emphasis on methodological aspects.
 A major drawback of the trials is the limited number of patients included.
 The existing evidence of positive effects of vitamin B6 is weak, and some well-designed trials with positive results would be needed to change this view.
