Myotonic dystrophy: quantification of muscle weakness and myotonia and the effect of amitriptyline and exercise.
 The purpose of this study was to quantify the degree of muscle weakness and myotonia in 12 patients with myotonic dystrophy (MD), and to quantitatively determine the effects of a four- to six-month therapeutic trial of amitriptyline.
 Patients had exercised with weights for one or more years.
 Some had shown initial improvement in muscle strength, but had reached a plateau; others had not improved when the study began.
 Muscle weakness was quantified by comparing the five-second maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in newtons (N) per kg (body weight) of 12 patients and 20 healthy subjects.
 Knee extensor, elbow flexor, and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles were compared.
 Myotonia was quantified by measuring relaxation times (RTs) at the end of the five-second MVC produced by FDI, as the time taken for the MVC to decrease by 50% and 75% (referred to as 1/2 and 3/4RT).
 The results were as follows: (1) the mean muscle strength of each of the three muscles of the patients was significantly (p less than .001) reduced compared with healthy subjects; and (2) 1/2 and 3/4RT means of the patients (vs healthy subjects) were significantly prolonged (p less than .01).
 Eight of the patients participated in a therapeutic trial of amitriptyline.
 Therapeutic effects were quantified by measuring muscle strength, 1/2 and 3/4RT, and percent change in evoked muscle action potential (MAP) from the FDI muscle after a ten-second MVC, to determine change in excitability.
 Mean muscle strength of FDI improved from .27 to .33N/kg, (p less than .05).
