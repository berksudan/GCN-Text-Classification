Hormone implants and tachyphylaxis.
 The serum oestradiol levels of 1388 women treated with hormone implants at a menopause clinic were reviewed in 1988.
 Thirty-eight (3%) were found to be above 1750 pmol/l.
 Of these 38 women with supraphysiological oestradiol levels 23 had started therapy for menopausal symptoms and 15 for the premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
 Of the 23 women treated for menopausal symptoms 11 had a history of psychiatric referral for depression and nine had undergone a surgical menopause.
 Nine of the 15 women with PMS had a history of psychiatric referral for depressive symptoms.
 We conclude that the women who attain supraphysiological levels of oestradiol on implant therapy have a high frequency of psychopathology or surgical menopause and may require higher oestradiol levels for adequate control of symptoms.
