Percutaneous puncture of a nondeflatable coronary artery angioplasty balloon.
 We report a case in which a balloon catheter became permanently inflated in a coronary artery saphenous vein bypass graft.
 While still inflated, the balloon was forcibly withdrawn from the graft into the external iliac artery and successfully deflated via percutaneous puncture using a CHIBA needle.
