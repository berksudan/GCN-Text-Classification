Low-dose almitrine bismesylate enhances hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in closed-chest dogs.
 The effect of almitrine bismesylate on the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response was studied in six closed-chest dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital and paralyzed with pancuronium.
 The right lung was ventilated continuously with 100% O2; the left lung was ventilated either with 100% O2 ("hyperoxia") or with an hypoxic gas mixture ("hypoxia": end-tidal oxygen tension = 60.3 +/- 0.6 mm Hg).
 On two consecutive days, each dog received either almitrine (Vectarion, Servier Lab) or malic acid.
 Consecutive almitrine doses of 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, and 3.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, or the equivalent volumes of malic acid without almitrine, were administered intravenously as a constant peripheral infusion for 15 min.
 Percent blood flow to each lung was calculated based on a variation of the traditional shunt equation.
 The change in percent left lung blood flow (delta %QL-VA) increased significantly between the hypoxia-no drug and the hypoxia-almitrine (3.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) phase.
 No significant changes occurred during the other almitrine doses or the respective malic acid control phases.
 The change in arterial oxygen tension (delta PaO2) also increased significantly between the hypoxia-no drug and the hypoxia-almitrine (3.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) phase.
 No significant changes occurred during the other almitrine doses or the respective malic acid control phases.
 It is concluded that in dogs low-dose almitrine enhances hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that this enhancement is dose-related.
