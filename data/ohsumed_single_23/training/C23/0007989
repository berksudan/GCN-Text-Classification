Liver transplantation: the shadow side.
 For a relatively large number of patients with liver disease, a liver transplant does not always provide a successful solution.
 What does confrontation with this modern technology mean for those involved? We interviewed 30 relatives of patients who had died after they had been turned down for a transplant, or during or shortly after a liver transplant operation performed in the Groningen Liver Transplant Programme.
 Quantitative data were obtained by means of a questionnaire.
 One-third of the respondents were of the opinion that the patient would have been better off if he/she had not entered the programme.
 Over half found the loss more difficult to accept because the patient had been involved in the programme.
 Nevertheless, many had the feeling of satisfaction that everything possible had been done.
 However fruitful transplantation technology may be for a specific group of patients, it also involves undesirable side-effects which should be included in the careful judgement of this technology.
