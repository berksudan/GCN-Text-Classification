Influence of high-dose aprotinin treatment on blood loss and coagulation patterns in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization.
 Intraoperative administration of the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin causes reduction in blood loss and homologous blood requirement in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
 To ascertain the blood-saving effect of aprotinin and to obtain further information about the mode of action, 40 patients undergoing primary myocardial revascularization were randomly assigned to receive either aprotinin or placebo treatment.
 Aprotinin was given as a bolus of 2 x 10(6) kallikrein inactivator units (KIU) before surgery followed by a continuous infusion of 5 x 10(5) KIU/h during surgery.
 Additionally, 2 x 10(6) KIU were added to the pump prime.
 Strict criteria were used to obtain a homogeneous patient selection.
 Total blood loss was reduced from 1,431 +/- 760 ml in the control group to 738 +/- 411 ml in the aprotinin group (P less than 0.05) and the homologous blood requirement from 838 +/- 963 ml to 163 +/- 308 ml (P less than 0.05).
 In the control group, 2.3 +/- 2.2 U of homologous blood or blood products were given, and in the aprotinin group, 0.63 +/- 0.96 U were given (P less than 0.05).
 Twenty-five percent of patients in the control group and 63% in the aprotinin group did not receive banked blood or homologous blood products.
 The activated clotting time as an indicator of inhibition of the contact phase of coagulation was significantly increased before heparinization in the aprotinin group (141 +/- 13 s vs.
 122 +/- 25 s) and remained significantly increased until heparin was neutralized after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
