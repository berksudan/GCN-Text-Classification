An interdisciplinary nutrition assessment and intervention protocol for children with disabilities.
 Because of the multifactorial nature of the nutrition problems associated with developmental disabilities, a well-organized, interdisciplinary effort is necessary to deal with such problems.
 A team composed of professional and support staff, the client, and the family needs to be involved in an integrated approach to service.
 The team members share their knowledge and expertise in developing an individual program plan to meet identified needs.
 This article describes the development and implementation of a prototype for interdisciplinary nutritional evaluation and intervention in an outpatient setting.
 In 1987, a Regional Nutrition and Feeding Diagnosis and Evaluation Clinic was established through a contractual agreement between the University of Georgia University Affiliated Program and St.
 Mary's Hospital in Athens, GA.
 The purposes of the clinic are twofold: to offer direct services to developmentally disabled infants and children who require outpatient services and to provide a unique community-based interdisciplinary training experience for graduate students in nutrition and other health disciplines.
 The interdisciplinary treatment protocol is based on current knowledge in the treatment of developmental disabilities.
