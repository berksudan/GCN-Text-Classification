Total perinatal wastage. A clarification of priorities.
 The pregnancy outcome of 16,971 women carrying 17,352 living fetuses after 16 weeks gestation was studied.
 As well as recording perinatal deaths, all losses before 28 weeks and up to one year after delivery were recorded to give a total perinatal wastage rate of 21.6 per 1000 fetuses alive at 16 weeks compared with a perinatal mortality rate (stillbirths plus early neonatal deaths) of 7.8 per 1000 births.
 All deaths were then classified according to pathological sub-groups.
 The concept of auditing perinatal care using perinatal mortality was then compared with that using total perinatal wastage.
