Monitoring platelet interactions with prosthetic graft implants in a canine model.
 This study shows that prosthetic arterial grafts stimulate platelets for as long as 1 year after implantation in a canine model.
 Carotid-to-distal aorta Dacron (DuPont, Wilmington, DE) grafts (0.8 x 50.0 cm) were tunneled subcutaneously over the right dorsal side, allowing for percutaneous arterial sampling.
 Thromboxane B2 (TxB2) levels were evaluated at the proximal anastomosis (w), 5.0 (x), 25.0 (y), and 50.0 (z) cm distal from w, and platelet counts and mean platelet volumes were monitored at sites w and z.
 TxB2 levels increased after blood entered the graft and progressively increased until the blood exited at the distal anastomosis.
 Platelet counts did not significantly change across the graft.
 Over time, systemic platelet counts decreased to approximately 50% of each dog's pregraft baseline levels and remained depressed over a 1 year period.
 Mean platelet volumes peaked 1-3 weeks after implant and remained greater than pregraft levels.
 Examination of the graft luminal surface showed a developed pseudointima characteristically similar to that which develops in mature human vascular grafts.
 These results suggest that healed vascular grafts in canines continue to stimulate platelet release of TxB2, reduce systemic platelet counts, and increase mean platelet volumes over 1 year.
 These data further suggest that platelets are stimulated by the graft and consumed.
