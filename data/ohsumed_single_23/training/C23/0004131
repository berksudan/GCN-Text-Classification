Distribution of pulmonary capillary transit times in recruited networks.
 When pulmonary blood flow is elevated, hypoxemia can occur in the fastest-moving erythrocytes if their transit times through the capillaries fall below the minimum time for complete oxygenation.
 This desaturation is more likely to occur if the distribution of capillary transit times about the mean is large.
 Increasing cardiac output is known to decrease mean pulmonary capillary transit time, but the effect on the distribution of transit times has not been reported.
 We measured the mean and variance of transit times in single pulmonary capillary networks in the dependent lung of anesthetized dogs by in vivo videofluorescence microscopy of a fluorescein dye bolus passing from an arteriole to a venule.
 When cardiac output increased from 2.9 to 9.9 l/min, mean capillary transit time decreased from 2.0 to 0.8 s.
 Because transit time variance decreased proportionately (relative dispersion remained constant), increasing cardiac output did not alter the heterogeneity of local capillary transit times in the lower lung where the capillary bed was nearly fully recruited.
