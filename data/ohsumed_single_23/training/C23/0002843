Cochlear implant flap complications.
 In a series of 52 patients who received cochlear implants, 4 patients suffered flap complications (7.7%).
 The problems encountered involved the postauricular flap and were usually minor in nature.
 None required explantation as a direct result of these complications.
 Flap ischemia in a patient with Cogan's syndrome and vasculitis, two cases of suture extrusion with one having exposure of the implant, and a case of receiver unit magnet extrusion repaired with a vascularized pericranial flap based upon temporalis muscle are presented.
 Flap design in patients who have had postauricular incisions demands special consideration.
 Principles useful for avoiding complications as well as their management are discussed.
