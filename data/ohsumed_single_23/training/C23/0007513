Simplified technique for control of femoral arterial bleeding after coronary angioplasty.
 A method of achieving arterial control by inserting an embolectomy catheter through the femoral introducer sheath in the patient with femoral arterial bleeding after PTCA is described herein.
 This approach allows quick control with less dissection and negligible blood loss.
