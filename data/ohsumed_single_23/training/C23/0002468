Ethical principles in geriatric nephrology.
 Seven principles are suggested to resolve ethical issues raised by medical developments affecting an aging society.
 First, there must be clear identification of the goals of medical treatment.
 Second, treatments must consider the whole person.
 Third, physiological concerns are more important than chronological age.
 Fourth, a patient's choice must be respected when choice is the result of an informed decision-making process.
 Fifth, access has to be equitable while respecting the sixth principle which requires allocation of resources.
 Finally, society must more clearly identify the appropriate principles to guide the care of the dying person.
