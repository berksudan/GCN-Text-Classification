Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of gastroepiploic artery graft.
 The right gastroepiploic artery is being used as a third arterial conduit for coronary artery bypass surgery.
 Presented here is a case demonstrating successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the gastroepiploic artery graft.
 This successful accomplishment may avoid repeat surgical revascularization in case of failure of the gastroepiploic artery graft, hence may encourage people to use it more often.
