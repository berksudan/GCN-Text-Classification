Development and reversibility of T lymphocyte dysfunction in experimental obstructive jaundice 
 This study evaluates the effect of experimental biliary obstruction by bile duct ligation (BDL) and biliary drainage on cell-mediated immunity in Wistar rats.
 Immune status has been assessed by a mitogen stimulation test of T lymphocytes with phytohaemagglutinin.
 Animals were followed for up to 35 days after BDL.
 Regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation between lymphocyte function and the period of jaundice (correlation coefficient -0.57, P less than 0.001).
 Following BDL for 21 days, groups of animals had internal biliary drainage for 7, 14 and 28 days, and external drainage for 14 days.
 Compared with obstructed animals, 14 days internal drainage was required to improve lymphocyte function (P less than 0.05).
 Animals which had 14 days of external drainage had significantly lower lymphocyte stimulation than internal drainage animals (P less than 0.05).
 The results demonstrate that obstructive jaundice produces a progressive reduction of T lymphocyte function.
 This can be reversed by biliary drainage, internal drainage being more effective than external drainage.
