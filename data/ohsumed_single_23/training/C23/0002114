A comparison of hospital costs and morbidity between octogenarians and other patients undergoing general surgical operations.
 The hospital costs and clinical results of 304 patients who were more than 80 years old and who underwent general surgical procedures were evaluated.
 The over-all mortality rate was 14 per cent; 19.9 per cent occurred in patients admitted under emergency conditions as compared with 8.9 per cent that occurred in patients undergoing elective procedures (p less than 0.001).
 Seventy-nine per cent of the patients were discharged and 7 per cent required care in a skilled nursing facility.
 Survival rates were as good or better than standard life table survival rates for 80 year old patients.
 Costs were higher in those who were admitted under emergent conditions or who died in the hospital.
 Deaths were a result of complications of the primary disease rather than associated disease in most groups.
 Neither costs nor length of stay could accurately predict survival of individual patients.
 We concluded that health resources should be directed at treating problems, such as cholelithiasis, hernia or carcinoma, early before complications develop.
