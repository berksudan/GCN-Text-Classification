Immune responses to allogeneic and xenogeneic implants of collagen and collagen derivatives.
 Whereas xenogeneic collagen has provided a safe and effective biomaterial for numerous medical applications, there are few instances in which data permit the correlation of the immunologic profile of well-defined devices with their clinical sequelae.
 A major exception is the use of injectable bovine dermal collagen for soft-tissue contour correction.
 The low incidence of hypersensitivity has been studied in the context of clinical efficacy and safety with several devices.
 The findings indicate that such immunity usually results in the manifestation of local symptoms of dermal inflammation at sites of treatment that resolve as the implant is resorbed by the host.
 In contrast, more immunogenic hemostatic agents may elicit a more frequent or vigorous immune response that is not clinically visible or relevant in that application.
 Recent experiences with collagen-based devices for the repair and regeneration of bone have also demonstrated that the presence of immunity to their collagenous or non-collagenous components does not necessarily predict adverse clinical sequelae.
 Indeed, numerous specific data indicate that this immunity can exist as an epiphenomenon with no effect on osteogenesis.
 To get a true composite picture of biocompatibility, significant steps must be taken to characterize biomaterials properly and to ensure that immunologic, clinical, histologic, and other pertinent laboratory data are viewed in relation to one another and not in isolation.
