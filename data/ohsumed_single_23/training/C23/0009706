Evaluation of 13C-urea breath test in the detection of Helicobacter pylori and in monitoring the effect of tripotassium dicitratobismuthate in non-ulcer dyspepsia 
 Sixty nine patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia have been studied with endoscopy, biopsy, quick urease (CLO) test, Helicobacter pylori culture, and the 13C-urea breath test before and after treatment with tripotassium dicitratobismuthane (DeNol) two tablets twice daily for four weeks.
 Symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia were recorded using a standard questionnaire.
 Using H pylori culture as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the 13C-urea breath test was 90%, the specificity 98.6%, and the accuracy 94.8% with a positive predictive value of 98.2% and a negative predictive value of 92.5%.
 Conversion rate from H pylori positive to negative status after treatment with tripotassium dicitratobismuthate was 17.9%.
 Symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia improved appreciably after treatment irrespective of H pylori status.
 The 13C-urea breath test is an accurate research tool suitable for serial testing and population surveys.
