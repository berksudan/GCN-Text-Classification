Continuous epidural hydromorphone for postthoracotomy pain relief 
 Forty-four patients were treated with a continuous infusion of lumbar epidural hydromorphone (0.05%) after thoracic operations.
 Postoperatively, visual analog pain scores were obtained.
 On postoperative day 1 and 2, more than 90% of the patients experienced either no pain (visual analog pain scale = 0) or mild pain (visual analog pain score = 1 to 3) at rest.
 The incidence of side effects (hypoventilation, pruritis, and nausea) was less than reported with other epidurally administered opioids.
 Continuous infusion of lumbar epidural hydromorphone produced safe, predictable analgesia after thoracotomy.
