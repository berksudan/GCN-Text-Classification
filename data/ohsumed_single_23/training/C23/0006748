Femoral arteriovenous fistula as a complication of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. A report of five cases.
 Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) associated with invasive and diagnostic angiographic procedures is rare.
 The incidence is increased with procedures such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) but is still quite low.
 We report five cases of AVF within a 17-month period, representing 0.15 per cent of all cardiac catheterizations and 0.87 per cent of PTCAs.
 All five patients presented with groin bruits.
 There were two associated pseudoaneurysms and one patient with deep vein thrombosis.
 All patients underwent uneventful division of the fistula.
 A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the femoral triangle is necessary in order to avoid this complication.
 That all fistulas were in the superficial or profunda femoris arteries emphasizes the importance of avoiding a low groin puncture.
 Early angiography and surgical intervention are recommended for optimal results.
