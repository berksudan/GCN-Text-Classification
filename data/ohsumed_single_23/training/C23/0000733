Blood loss reduced during hip arthroplasty by lumbar plexus block.
 We measured the blood loss during and after hip replacement in two groups of women, each consisting of 10 patients.
 In one group the lumbar plexus was infiltrated with bupivacaine, in the other it was not.
 The group in whom the plexus was blocked had significantly less blood loss.
