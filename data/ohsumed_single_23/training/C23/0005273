Acute hypervolaemic haemodilution to avoid blood transfusion during major surgery 
 16 patients underwent acute hypervolaemic haemodilution with dextran 40 and Ringers lactate, to see whether this procedure could avoid preoperative blood transfusion.
 Packed cell volume (PCV) and oxygen extraction decreased, and cardiac index and pulmonary wedge pressure increased, although end-systolic area was unchanged.
 PCV was not significantly different between patients who lost less than or greater than 20% of their initial blood volume.
 This preoperative manoeuvre, which reduces loss of red blood cells, allowed major surgery to be completed safely without blood transfusion.
