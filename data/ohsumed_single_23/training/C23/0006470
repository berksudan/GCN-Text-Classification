Mechanisms of edema formation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The contribution of inflammatory cells.
 Most of the central nervous system (CNS) endothelium regulates the passage of solutes and functions as a blood-brain barrier (BBB).
 During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, loss of BBB function occurs.
 The authors have previously shown an increase in endothelial transcytotic activity associated with decreased mitochondrial content as evidence of BBB dysfunction in EAE.
 These changes occurred in the capillary bed and correlated with CNS edema and clinical signs.
 In the present report, a fixation procedure before infusion of the intravascular tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in rats at the height of clinical EAE has been used.
 In these animals, tracer leakage was only noted in inflamed venules with diameters of 12 to 19 mu.
 The authors detected several mechanisms of passive leakage: 1) increased junctional permeability; 2) increased interendothelial space; 3) leakage alongside migrating inflammatory cells.
 Some small capillaries showed necrotic changes with minimal tracer leakage.
 This report demonstrates that BBB disruption also occurs via nonendocytic mechanisms that may be induced by inflammatory cells.
