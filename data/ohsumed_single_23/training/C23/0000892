Problem solving in implant dentistry.
 Dental implants have become an accepted form of dental care, with reported functional 5-year success rates of 90% and higher.
 These impressive statistics include, but do not identify, the problems that may have been created by clinical ineptitude.
 Diagnostic acumen and preventive measures at each stage of the implant treatment can avoid many problems.
 Also, appropriate measures of timely recognition, rescue, and repair can often restore ailing implants and their prosthetic appliances to full function.
