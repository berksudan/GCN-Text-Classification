Percutaneous pedestal in cochlear implantation.
 Direct electrical connection between an external sound-processing device and intracochlear electrodes is accomplished via a percutaneous pedestal.
 Patient pedestal complaints and experience have been recorded.
 Pedestal problems have been classified into six classes, with class 0 indicating no problems and the severity of problem increasing in classes 1 through 4.
 Class 5 indicates pedestal trauma.
 No class 5 problems were encountered.
 At 48 months of experience, 53% of patients were class 0 and 26% were class 1.
 The pedestal experience is detailed in the paper.
 The percutaneous pedestal has been found to be a well-tolerated, efficient system for information transfer in cochlear implant patients.
