The use of the Jarvik-7 total artificial heart and the Symbion ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplantation.
 The proliferation of transplantation programs has not been paralleled by a similar increase in the availability of organ donors.
 Between 1984 and 1987, 104 orthotopic heart transplantations were performed at Loyola University Medical Center.
 During the same period, 25 patients died while awaiting a donor organ.
 To reduce the mortality, we began using the total artificial heart (TAH) and a ventricular assist device (VAD) as a bridge to transplantation in 1988.
 Of 29 patients who underwent transplantation, 15 patients required a TAH and three patients required a VAD as a bridge.
 The underlying heart conditions were ischemic cardiomyopathy (11 patients), dilated cardiomyopathy (5 patients), giant cell myocarditis (1 patient), and allograft failure (1 patient).
 The average duration of mechanical support was 10 days (range, 1 to 35 days).
 Of the 17 patients who successfully underwent transplantation, 1 patient died at 17 days because of acute rejection of the transplanted heart, and another patient died at 14 days because of a cerebral vascular event.
 Fifteen patients (83%) were long-term survivors.
 Nine patients required reoperation for bleeding.
 While the mechanical device was in place, the activated clotting time was maintained between 170 and 200 seconds with heparin.
 Dipyridamole was given.
 We conclude that the TAH and VAD are excellent mechanical bridges to transplantation.
