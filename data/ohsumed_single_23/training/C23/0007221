Chronic illness and depressive symptoms in the elderly: a population-based study.
 A cross-sectional study of the distribution of depressive symptoms and association between depressed mood and chronic illness was conducted in a geographically defined population in southern California of 1617 men and women aged 65 years and older.
 The prevalence of depressed mood for the total population was 5.2%.
 Women exhibited a significantly higher mean depressive symptom score and a prevalence rate almost twice that of men.
 Depressive symptoms were associated with several risk factors in both sexes, including age, self-perception of current health status, number of reported chronic diseases and medications and amount of exercise.
 However, the relationship between physical illness and depressive symptoms appeared to differ by sex with respect to the nature of the disease or disability and the type of medication currently used.
 These findings indicate that the risk of depression does not diminish with age among the elderly as other studies have suggested.
