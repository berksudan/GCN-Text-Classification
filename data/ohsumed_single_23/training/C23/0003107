Urgent care center pediatric telephone advice.
 Pediatric telephone advice is sought frequently by members of the community.
 This study was undertaken to evaluate the quality and accuracy of pediatric telephone advice given by free-standing urgent care centers.
 One hundred such facilities were telephoned and advice was requested by a research assistant.
 A case was presented that could have represented a pediatric medical emergency.
 Overall only 17 centers gave adequate advice.
 The data suggest that under some circumstances free-standing urgent care center pediatric telephone advice may be inaccurate and inappropriate.
 Workable policies and protocols for pediatric telephone advice should be instituted by these facilities.
