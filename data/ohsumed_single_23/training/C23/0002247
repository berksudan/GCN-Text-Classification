Urothelial grafts in mice.
 Mouse bladder epithelium has been successfully transplanted to the bladders of syngeneic mice and has survived for at least twenty weeks.
 The fate of the transplanted tissue was followed using a fluorescein label.
 The recipient bladders were prepared by stripping the urothelium either by a surgical or a chemical method.
 The possibility of adopting a comparable technique for the treatment of early bladder cancer in man is discussed.
