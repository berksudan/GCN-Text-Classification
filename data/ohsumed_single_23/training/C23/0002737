Electrocardiographic abnormalities in cerebrovascular accidents.
 The electrocardiographic abnormalities found in 100 patients with acute cerebrovascular disease and previously normal hearts are described.
 The abnormalities were more often seen in patients with intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages.
 The most common changes were Q-Tc Prolongation and ST segment and T wave abnormalities.
 The mechanisms of these electrocardiographic abnormalities appear to be multiple.
