Treatment of chronic facial palsy by transplantation of the neurovascularized free rectus abdominis muscle.
 We performed neurovascularized free rectus abdominis muscle transplantations in two patients with chronic facial palsy.
 In one patient, the postoperative course was uneventful, but the patient died from rupture of esophageal varices.
 In the other patient, both morphologic and functional results were satisfactory.
 Therefore, the rectus abdominis muscle is considered to be a suitable donor for muscle transplantation for the treatment of chronic facial palsy.
 The rectus abdominis muscle is advantageous in that (1) simultaneous operations by two teams are possible with the patient in the supine position, (2) it is supplied by long nerves and long and large vessels, (3) it is flat and consists of segments with appropriate lengths, (4) the force and distance of contraction are appropriate, and (5) the tendinous intersections are suitable for anchoring sutures.
