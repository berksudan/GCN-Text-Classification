Simplified technique for isolating vascularized rib periosteal grafts.
 A modified technique for obtaining a vascularized rib periosteal segment utilizing the posterolateral approach is presented.
 The technique avoids the inclusion of a large muscle cuff or the pleura around the isolated rib segment and therefore minimizes donor-site morbidity and chest complications previously associated with this approach.
