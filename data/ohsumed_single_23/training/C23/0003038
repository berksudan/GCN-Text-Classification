Massive splenomegaly. Superior results with a combined endovascular and operative approach.
 Splenectomy for massive splenomegaly (drained splenic weight, greater than 1000 g) has an uncommonly high morbidity and mortality because of technical challenges and problems of hemostasis.
 In a group of 10 patients with massive splenomegaly due to myeloproliferative disorders (average splenic weight, 4193 g), we developed a management algorithm based on preoperative angiographic embolization of the splenic artery.
 Average operating time was 1.7 hours (range, 1 to 2.5 hours).
 Average blood loss was 528 mL; six of the 10 patients had blood loss less than 250 mL.
 There were four minor complications and one major complication (gastric ulcer requiring reoperation).
 There were no deaths in the perioperative period, and no patients required reoperation for hemorrhage.
