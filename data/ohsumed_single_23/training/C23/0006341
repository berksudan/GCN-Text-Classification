Primary abscess of the omentum.
 A 65-yr-old man presented with upper abdominal pain and fever due to a primary abscess of the omentum.
 The finding of microscopic-size foreign particles within the abscess raised the possibility of antecedent clinically silent perforation of the bowel or appendix.
 Surgical resection and antibiotic therapy were curative.
