Mechanical deficit persists during long-term muscle hypertrophy.
 Hypotheses were tested that the deficit in maximum isometric force normalized to muscle cross-sectional area (i.e., specific Po, N/cm2) of hypertrophied muscle would return to control value with time and that the rate and magnitude of adaptation of specific force would not differ between soleus and plantaris muscles.
 Ablation operations of the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles or the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were done to induce hypertrophy of synergistic muscle left intact in female Wistar rats (n = 47) at 5 wk of age.
 The hypertrophied soleus and plantaris muscles and control muscles from other age-matched rats (n = 22) were studied from days 30 to 240 thereafter.
 Po was measured in vitro at 25 degrees C in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate.
 Compared with control values, soleus muscle cross-sectional area increased 41-15% from days 30 to 240 after ablation, whereas Po increased 11 and 15% only at days 60 and 90.
 Compared with control values, plantaris muscle cross-sectional area increased 52% at day 30, 40% from days 60 through 120, and 15% at day 240.
 Plantaris muscle Po increased 25% from days 30 to 120 but at day 240 was not different from control value.
 Changes in muscle architecture were negligible after ablation in both muscles.
 Specific Po was depressed from 11 to 28% for both muscles at all times.
 At no time after the ablation of synergistic muscle did the increased muscle cross-sectional area contribute fully to isometric force production.
