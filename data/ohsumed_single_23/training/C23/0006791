Tracheotomy in the first year of life.
 Much has been written concerning complications of pediatric tracheotomies, but few studies have reviewed the complication rates of tracheotomies performed in the first 12 months of life.
 We reviewed the records of 60 patients who underwent tracheotomy in the first year of life between 1976 and 1988.
 This study includes 30 full-term infants and 30 premature infants, 16 of whom were very low birth weight preterm infants (less than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation and less than 1,500 g birth weight).
 Overall complication rates were 3% intraoperative, 13% early postoperative, and 38% late postoperative.
 The early postoperative complication rate in preterm infants was nearly double that of full-term infants.
 The late postoperative complication rate of patients undergoing tracheotomy for airway obstruction was more than double that of patients requiring tracheotomy for pulmonary indications.
 Duration of tracheotomy, however, was felt to be the most important factor in the development of a late postoperative complication.
