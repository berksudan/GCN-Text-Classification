Meropenem pharmacokinetics and penetration into an inflammatory exudate.
 The pharmacokinetics and penetration into a cantharidine-induced inflammatory exudate of meropenem was studied in six volunteers following a single 1-g intravenous dose.
 Concentrations in plasma, urine, and the inflammatory exudate were determined by a microbiological assay.
 The mean elimination half-life of meropenem in plasma was 1.1 h, with the concentration in plasma declining from a mean of 23.6 micrograms/ml at 1 h to 0.7 micrograms/ml at 6 h.
 The inflammatory fluid penetration was rapid (time to maximum concentration of drug in serum, 0.75 h), and the penetration was 111%.
 The recovery of meropenem in urine at 24 h was 65.4% of the administered dose.
