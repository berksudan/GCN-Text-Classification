Balloon expandable stent implantation in stenotic right heart valved conduits.
 Although valved conduits have been used successfully in severe forms of right ventricular-pulmonary artery discontinuity, progressive valved conduit stenosis is an important clinical problem.
 To determine the feasibility of reducing right heart valved conduit stenosis with a balloon expandable stent, a baboon model was used, in which the pulmonary artery was ligated and a right ventricular to pulmonary artery 14 mm bioprosthetic Dacron valved conduit implanted.
 In five baboons, at an average of 40 months after valved conduit implantation, fibrointimal stenosis at the valve site resulted in narrowing and a mean transconduit pressure gradient of 49 mm Hg (range 33 to 65).
 A tubular slotted steel stent (1.2 cm long) was deployed within the valved conduit after inflation of an 8 to 15 mm diameter balloon catheter that was introduced through the femoral vein.
 A stent was delivered to all valved conduits; however, in two baboons, balloon undersizing resulted in stent dislodgment.
 In the remaining three baboons, the transconduit gradient was reduced by 59% (49 to 20 mm Hg) and right ventricular systolic pressure decreased acutely by 35% (77 to 50 mm Hg).
 It is concluded that stent deployment is feasible in right ventricular to pulmonary artery stenotic valved conduits and may result in significant hemodynamic improvement.
 However, successful stent delivery is critically dependent on the proper selection of stent length and balloon diameter.
