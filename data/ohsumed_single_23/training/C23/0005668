Neurologic assessment.
 Neurologic nursing assessment requires the knowledge of anatomic and physiologic principles as well as the mastery of complex assessment skills.
 The nurse who is often the first and most consistent health team member interacting with clients may provide the key to the early recognition, prevention, and treatment of neurologic problems.
 The nurse, as the dynamic member of the health team, may then be the first line of defense in initiating cost-effective and perhaps life-saving measures in neurologically impaired clients.
