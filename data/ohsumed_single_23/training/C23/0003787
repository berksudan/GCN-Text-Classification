Association of anterior ectopic anus and partial absence of levator musculature in a woman with impaired defecation. Report of a case.
 A 25-year-old nulliparous woman with adult onset constipation and slight anterior displacement of the anus underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging and was diagnosed with congenital hemiabsence of the levator ani sling.
 Impaired defecation was confirmed by anorectal function studies and defecography demonstrated an anterior rectocele, perineal descent at the upper limit of normal, and partial obstruction of defecation, which appeared related to the levator sling abnormality.
 To our knowledge, this combination of findings has not been previously described as a cause of adult onset constipation.
