"Cloggology" revisited: endoscopic or surgical decompression of malignant biliary obstruction.
 In this study, 50 consecutive patients over age 60 with obstructive jaundice secondary to malignant stricture of the distal common bile duct were identified by endoscopic cholangiography.
 The patients were then randomized to palliative therapy with either endoscopic endoprosthesis or bypass surgery.
 Prospective indices of survival time, complication rates, hospitalization requirements, and quality of life were followed.
 All 25 patients randomized to endoprosthesis were treated by this procedure, whereas only 19 of 25 patients randomized to bypass surgery underwent operative biliary-digestive anastomosis.
 No difference in the above indices were found between the two groups.
 The authors concluded that palliation of obstructive jaundice due to a malignant bile duct stricture with endoscopically placed biliary stent is as effective as operative bypass.
