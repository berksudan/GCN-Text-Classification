Laryngeal framework reconstruction with miniplates.
 Defects of the laryngeal framework after trauma, cancer, and thyroplasty have been reconstructed with mini-reconstruction plates.
 Six patients had miniplates used to repair the thyroid cartilage defect after type I thyroplasty to prevent lateralization of the Silastic implant; three patients had miniplates used after hemilaryngectomy to bridge the thyroid cartilage remnants, resulting in better deglutition after hemilaryngectomy; and three patients had miniplates used to repair laryngeal fractures.
 The plates were tolerated well by the patients; there were no major complications.
 Rigid fixation using miniplates for laryngeal reconstruction has unique advantages over the use of wires.
 It offers the advantages of rigid and immediate stabilization with the ability to bridge large defects.
 It can be an alternative to existing techniques of laryngeal reconstruction.
