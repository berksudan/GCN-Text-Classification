The detubularized right colonic segment as urinary reservoir: evolution of technique for continent diversion.
 Continent diversion of urine via a cecal-right colonic reservoir has been performed at our university hospital since 1977.
 Several modifications of surgical technique have been devised to prevent problems of urinary leakage and difficulties in catheterization.
 The current technique, used during the last 3 years on 14 patients, involves use of a detubularized right colonic segment as a reservoir, ileal mesenteric exclusion, fashioning the intussuscepted ileal nipple valve with staples and anchoring of a fascia strip sling around the nipple base to the anterior rectus sheath.
 Complication from the reservoir outlet occurred in only 1 patient.
