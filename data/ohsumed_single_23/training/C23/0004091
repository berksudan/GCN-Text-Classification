Desmopressin and antifibrinolytics.
 Desmopressin appears to be a safe and effective hemostatic agent for use during surgery in patients with mild to moderate hemophilia or von Willebrand disease.
 Uremic patients also benefit from substitution of desmopressin for cryoprecipitate to control bleeding.
 The highly variable response to desmopressin by individual patients with hemophilia or von Willebrand disease dictates that each patient receive a trial administration prior to surgery; surgery should proceed only following verification of a therapeutically effective increase in Factor VIII and vWF after desmopressin.
 Use of desmopressin in patients with normal baseline hemostatic function is not clearly advantageous, although certain patient subgroups might benefit, and prospective studies have documented the drug's safety in these cases.
 Data are lacking to clarify a role for desmopressin during surgery in patients taking aspirin.
 Antifibrinolytic therapy appears to decrease bleeding without increased risk after cardiac surgery.
 In addition, specific use after urological surgery may be beneficial in the absence of upper urinary tract bleeding.
 In the last ten years, other applications for antifibrinolytic therapy have been found--both surgical (intracranial aneurysms, oral and lacrimal surgery) and nonsurgical (in cancer patients and for gastrointestinal bleeding).
 Although anecdotal reports have fueled fears of increased thrombosis with antifibrinolytics, controlled studies indicate no increased risk.
