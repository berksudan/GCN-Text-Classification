The case for porous-coated hip implants. The femoral side.
 A series of 1163 total hip arthroplasties (THAs) using porous-coated femoral components were roentgenographically assessed for implant fixation.
 For 959 primary THAs followed from two to 12 years, the femoral revision rate was 1% and the ten-year survivorship rate was 96.4%; 150 young patients had a fixation failure incidence of only 1.3% at a mean follow-up period of 6.4 years; in 204 revision THAs, the femoral re-revision rate was 4% at a mean follow-up period of 53.4 months.
 Failures were largely related to inadequate femoral canal filling.
 Because of refinements in implant design and surgical techniques, a press fit of the implant is currently achieved in 94% of cases compared to 36% during the first five years.
 Porous-coated femoral components have yielded results equivalent to those with cement in primary THAs.
 Excellent results were observed in relatively young patients and patients with revisions.
