Vertigo after epidural morphine.
 Severe complications from the use of epidural morphine for analgesia after Caesarean section are rare.
 A case is reported of extreme prostrating vertigo several hours after epidural morphine injection, where the time of onset of the symptom coincided with the expected time of arrival of the morphine within intra-cerebral cerebro-spinal fluid.
