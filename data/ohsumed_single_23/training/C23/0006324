Neurodevelopmental performance of very-low-birth-weight infants with mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage. Outcome at 5 to 6 years of age.
 The neurodevelopmental outcome of 38 very-low-birth-weight neonates (birth weight, less than 1501 g) was followed up prospectively from birth to 5 to 6 years of age to assess the neurodevelopmental sequelae of mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (grades I and II).
 All neonates were screened for periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage at 5 to 10 days of age.
 Eleven incurred a mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (group 1) and 27 had no periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (group 2).
 Each of the infants was neurodevelopmentally normal at 1 to 2 years of age.
 The 38 children were matched by race, age, sex, and socioeconomic status with control children (group 3) who had been born at term.
 On outcome measurements at 5 to 6 years of age, groups 1 and 2 scored significantly lower than group 3 on the combined test measurements and on three of the four individual measurements.
 Group 1 scored significantly lower than group 2 on the combined test measurements only.
 These data indicate that very-low-birth-weight infants are at risk for learning problems.
 Although children with mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage did not demonstrate a significant deficit on individual test scores, the significant difference on the combined battery suggests that mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage has an adverse effect on global performance.
