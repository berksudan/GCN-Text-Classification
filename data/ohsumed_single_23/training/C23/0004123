Effects of tracheal irritation and hypercapnia on tracheal smooth muscle in humans.
 Both hypercapnia and tracheal irritation are known to constrict the airways in animals.
 To see whether similar responses occur in humans, we investigated tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) responses to hypercapnia and tracheal irritation with water in 14 paralyzed and anesthetized humans.
 TSM tone was monitored by measuring the pressure in the saline-filled cuff of the endotracheal tube.
 Although, tracheal irritation caused TSM constriction in 10 of 14 patients, 4 patients showed no TSM response.
 Administration of intravenous atropine attenuated the TSM constriction response.
 Hypercapnia did not cause any change in TSM tone in any of the 14 patients.
 These results indicate that in paralyzed and anesthetized humans, there exist interindividual differences in the TSM responses to tracheal irritation and that hypercapnia cannot be an effective stimulus for the TSM constriction.
