Observer reliability in detecting surreptitious random occlusions of the monaural esophageal stethoscope.
 The esophageal stethoscope is used often during anesthesia to monitor ventilation and cardiac function.
 Deficiencies in observer vigilance may limit the effectiveness of this monitoring instrument.
 The aim of this study was to determine how long it took for an observer to detect a surreptitiously occluded monaural esophageal stethoscope in the setting of clinical anesthesia.
 During routine anesthesia, where an esophageal stethoscope was in use, a computer-guided device would artificially, silently, and at random time intervals, occlude the stethoscope tubing.
 Personnel using the stethoscope noted when they perceived the absence of stethoscope sounds.
 We studied 320 stethoscope occlusions in 32 patients.
 The time between stethoscope occlusion and detection was 34 +/- 59 seconds (mean +/- SD).
 Eighty-seven percent of detections were made in less than 60 seconds.
 However, 13% of detections were delayed for more than 60 seconds, and 2.3% for more than 240 seconds.
 While anesthesia personnel using an esophageal stethoscope could detect most stethoscope occlusions, failure to appreciate such episodes occurred in a small but significant number of cases.
 This suggests that the esophageal stethoscope has some definite limitations as a continuous monitor and that other monitoring techniques, such as oximetry, capnography, and ventilator disconnect alarms, as well as visual/tactile inspection of the patient, should be used as well.
