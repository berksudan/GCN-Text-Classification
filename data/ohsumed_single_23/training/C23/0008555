Fascinating rhythm: a primer on chaos theory and its application to cardiology.
 Nonlinear dynamics is an exciting new way of looking at peculiarities that in the past have been ignored or explained away.
 We have attempted to give a general introduction to the basics of the mathematics, applications to cardiology, and a brief review of the new tools needed to use the concepts of nonlinear mathematics.
 The careful mathematical approach to problems in cardiac electrical dynamics and blood flow is opening a window on behaviors and mechanisms previously inaccessible.
