Postoperative bile duct strictures.
 Bile duct strictures are an uncommon but serious complication of primary operations on the gallbladder or biliary tree.
 Most strictures occur as a result of injury to the bile duct during cholecystectomy.
 In addition, strictures can occur at the site of previous biliary anastomoses for reconstruction of the biliary tree.
 Most patients with benign bile duct strictures present soon after their initial operation; however, in some cases, presentation is delayed for years.
 Cholangiography is essential for defining the anatomy of the biliary tree prior to management.
 In many cases, nonoperative biliary drainage is useful to treat sepsis and biliary fistulas.
 A number of alternatives exist for elective repair of bile duct strictures.
 Experience would suggest, however, that a choledochojejunostomy or hepaticojejunostomy performed through a Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum is the preferable management in most cases.
 Postoperative biliary stenting may be valuable in optimizing the results.
 Nonoperative management by percutaneous transhepatic or endoscopic balloon dilatation has been reported to be successful in a number of small series.
 Long-term results are limited, however.
 Comparative data suggest that surgical repair for benign postoperative strictures is associated with fewer long-term problems and with similar overall morbidity and costs.
