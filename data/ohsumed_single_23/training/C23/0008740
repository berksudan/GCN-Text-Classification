Profound digital collagen atrophy: a new cutaneous presentation of adrenal-dependent Cushing's syndrome.
 A 59-year-old Caucasian housewife presented with a 2-year history of marked loss of tissue substance from the finger and toe pulps and the heel pads.
 There was no clinical evidence or history of urticaria or other inflammatory change.
 Investigations demonstrated a raised plasma cortisol secondary to a left adrenal adenoma.
 Skin biopsies showed abnormalities of dermal collagen, but no evidence of elastin destruction.
 This case presents an unusual variant of the cutaneous atrophy associated with Cushing's syndrome.
