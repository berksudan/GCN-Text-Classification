A comparison of parallel versus perpendicular placement of retention sutures in abdominal wound closure.
 A new technique for placement of retention sutures is described.
 Twenty-five rats underwent midline laparotomy incision.
 The control group was closed with traditional placement of through-and-through retention sutures placed in a perpendicular direction to the wound.
 The experimental group was closed with retention sutures placed in a parallel direction to the wound as described below.
 Wound bursting strength was significantly (P less than 0.001) greater at one to five days in the experimental group compared with the control animals.
 In addition, inflammatory reaction and pressure necrosis were greater in the control group.
 It appears that parallel placement of sutures has less of a tendency to cut through tissue when subjected to the distracting forces on a midline wound.
