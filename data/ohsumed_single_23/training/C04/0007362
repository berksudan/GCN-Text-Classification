The melanocyte and melanoma.
 This paper reviewed some of the interesting biological aspects of melanocytes and their relationship to the nevus and to melanoma.
 It also proposed a rationale for "adequate" surgery in the management of melanoma according to level, depth, margins, and trends in treatment.
 These propositions were derived from an analysis of 995 cases of melanoma of the head and neck.
