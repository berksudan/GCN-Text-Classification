Brain stem and spinal metastases of supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme: a clinical series.
 Although the spread of supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme to the brain stem and spine has been extensively described in published autopsy series, information on the diagnosis, treatment, and subsequent clinical course of patients manifesting symptoms of glioblastomatous dissemination ante mortem remains scant.
 We report a series of 11 patients having the signs and symptoms of neuraxis dissemination of supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.
 All patients had radiographic documentation of metastases by either contrast-enhanced myelograms or enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans.
 Ten presented with spinal involvement, whereas one presented with lower cranial neuropathies secondary to diffuse involvement of the basal cisterns.
 The mean age of the patients was 38.5 years, and the mean time interval between diagnosis of intracranial disease and diagnosis of metastases was 14.1 months.
 After diagnosis of tumor spread, subsequent mean survival time was 2.8 months.
 All patients received additional radiotherapy to the areas of metastasis, but the clinical response to radiotherapy was quite poor.
 This study confirms previous reports in the literature suggesting that metastases occur in younger patients and in patients with extended survival.
 The findings suggest that the relatively infrequent clinical incidence of the symptomatic spread of glioblastoma multiforme, as compared with the frequent incidental discovery of such spread at autopsy, may be the result of the limited survival of the affected patients, and not due to the biology of the tumor.
