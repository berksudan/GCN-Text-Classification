Trends in basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma of the skin from 1973 through 1987.
 Major increases have occurred in the incidence of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, as well as in cutaneous malignant melanoma during the period 1973 through 1987 in British Columbia.
 The greatest increases in basal and squamous cell carcinomas are on the head and neck.
 This indicates that exposure to sunlight is the major causative factor.
 The greatest increase in melanoma is on the trunk in men and on the lower limbs in women.
 The dramatic increases in nonmelanoma skin cancers in British Columbia, a relatively low sunlight area, suggest that major prevention programs are needed in areas that are not considered "sunspots.".
