Use of the levator scapulae muscle flap in head and neck reconstruction.
 There are numerous techniques available for reconstruction of defects following composite resection of oral cavity and oropharyngeal tumors.
 No single technique is applicable in all situations.
 The levator scapulae muscle flap is well known for its application in carotid protection.
 Little attention is paid to its usefulness in other aspects of head and neck reconstruction.
 We have been using the levator scapulae muscle flap for a variety of reconstructive problems.
 The flap is useful for buttressing intraoral suture lines, closing intraoral defects, and providing soft tissue to fill in dead spaces and bulk out lateral and anterior oral defects.
 The levator flap was found to be easy to elevate, safe, and reliable with a minimum of wound complications.
 A review of 18 patients, representative case studies, and a discussion of surgical technique and relevant anatomy and blood supply is presented.
