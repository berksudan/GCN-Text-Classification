Carotid body tumors.
 The surgical management of carotid body tumors requires identification and preservation of neural and vascular structures without compromising resection of the neoplasm.
 Fifteen patients were examined and treated for carotid body tumors at the Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Foundation from 1979 through 1987.
 The benchmark of diagnosis is bilateral carotid angiography.
 When neural structures are free of tumor, meticulous dissection facilitates their preservation.
 Large tumor size increases risk for arterial resection necessitating reconstruction.
 The use of a vascular shunt minimizes the risk of cerebral ischemia.
 Postoperative intravenous digital subtraction angiography allows for evaluation of arterial repair.
 A retrospective review of 15 carotid body tumor resections performed in 14 patients revealed no evidence of tumor recurrence, no mortality associated with surgical intervention, no postoperative cerebrovascular accident, and limited morbidity associated with unavoidable sacrifice of neural elements.
