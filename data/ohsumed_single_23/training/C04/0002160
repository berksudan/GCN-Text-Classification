Local recurrence after curative resection of colorectal adenocarcinoma.
 A total of 853 patients with 861 colorectal adenocarcinomas were operated on at our institution between 1965 and 1981.
 Complete follow-up information was obtained in all but six patients (99.4%), and all available histologic slides were reviewed to determine pathologic stage and characteristics.
 Six hundred fifty-one patients (76.3%) underwent a potentially curative procedure, and their operative mortality rate was 2.8%.
 Of the 627 patients available for analysis, 50 (8%) had a local recurrence.
 The median time to local recurrence was 18 months, and only 16% of local recurrences were diagnosed 5 years after the original resection.
 Median survival of patients with a local recurrence was 3 1/2 years from the original resection, and 16 patients (32%) survived 5 years or longer.
 A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the influence of several clinical and pathologic characteristics on local recurrence among Dukes' stages B and C adenocarcinomas (n = 539) after exclusion of patients with synchronous tumors (n = 8), postoperative deaths (n = 18), loss to follow-up (n = 6), or incomplete data (n = 11).
 This analysis revealed that the local recurrence rate was significantly related to depth of invasion (B1 + C1 = 0%; B2 + C1 = 10%; p less than 0.01), site of origin (right plus transverse colon = 6%; left plus rectosigmoid colon = 10%; rectum = 12%; p less than 0.05), and lymphatic or capillary microinvasion (absent, 6%; present, 14%; p less than 0.05).
 This analysis attempts to identify patients at high risk for development of local recurrent disease to select candidates for postoperative adjuvant therapy.
