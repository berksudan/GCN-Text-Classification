The epidemiology of cancer among Hispanic women. The experience in Florida.
 To explore cancer incidence among Hispanic women living in Dade County, Florida, data were analyzed from the statewide cancer registry.
 For all but three sites, Hispanics had lower rates of the 15 most prevalent cancers than non-Hispanics.
 However, higher rates of cancer among Hispanics were noted for cancers of the gallbladder, liver, and heart and soft tissue.
 Subgroups of women had significantly higher rates of cervical cancer and thyroid cancer.
 Lower rates among Hispanics were observed for cancers of the esophagus, vagina, breast, colon, buccal cavity and pharynx, and malignant melanoma.
 These data suggest that most cancer sites traditionally higher among US Latino women were not higher among Dade Hispanics, and that sites more common among non-Hispanics have not yet shown an increased incidence among Hispanic women in Dade County.
