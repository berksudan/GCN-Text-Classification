Dacron fabric-enveloped hydroxyapatite prosthesis for sternal tumor defect: an autopsy report.
 A 38-year-old housewife with solitary plasmacytoma of the manubrium who underwent a subtotal sternectomy treated by resection of the lesion is reported.
 This was followed by replacement with a Dacron fabric-enveloped hydroxyapatite prosthesis.
 The Dacron fabric was sutured to the surrounding tissues, and then the clavicle was passed through the cylindrical-shaped Dacron fabric to form a sternoclavicular joint capsule.
 The patient returned to her daily life 3 months after the operation.
 She had no trouble in her daily living, without any dislocation of the sternoclavicular joints or any displacement of the artificial sternum.
 The autopsy examination about 1 year after the operation showed that the Dacron fabric enveloping the artificial sternum became stronger with time.
 The sternoclavicular joint also was stably fixed, and the Dacron fabric fulfilled its function as an artificial articular capsule and biologic fixation of the surrounding supporting tissues.
