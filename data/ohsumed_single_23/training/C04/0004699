Alternating cisplatinum and VAC ineffective in end stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
 Sixteen patients with end stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were admitted to a phase II study of alternating courses of cisplatinum (100 mg/m2) and VAC (vincristine 1.4 mg/m2, adriamycin 50 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2) given at three weekly intervals.
 Only two patients achieved a response (12 per cent).
 The median survival time was 62 days which is much the same as that of a similar group of patients who received no chemotherapy in a previous trial (70 days).
