Chondrosarcoma of the head and neck.
 Chondrosarcoma is a malignancy rarely encountered in the head and neck.
 In an attempt to define this tumor's characteristics and response to therapy, all cases of chondrosarcoma treated at the University of Michigan over the past 25 years were retrospectively studied.
 Fourteen cases originating in the nose and paranasal sinuses, mandible, temporal bone, and larynx were reviewed.
 Aggressive surgical resection was the mainstay of treatment, and resulted in an overall survival of 70%, with an average follow-up of 3.5 years.
 Survival was highest in primary temporal bone lesions, and lowest in paranasal sinus lesions.
 Unresectable lesions were not cured by other modalities.
 This study, therefore, continued to support the crucial role of wide surgical resection in the treatment of head and neck chondrosarcoma, but conservative resection, when needed to preserve important structures, has resulted in long-term survival.
