1990 Ogura memorial lecture: moral dilemmas in head and neck cancer.
 Neither morality nor dilemma can be defined meaningfully in the concept of the practical management of head and neck cancer.
 Although both have important implications, particularly with regard to ethnic and social factors, they play a relatively minor role in determining management policy.
 With little knowledge of the intrinsic causes of cancer and with a treatment strategy limited to radiotherapy and surgery, our desire for cure must be tempered by concern to avoid any increase in patient privations.
 My philosophy, based upon the care of more than 3500 patients over almost 30 years, reflects some of the difficulties of applying the concept "do nothing that may cause harm," while offering each patient the opportunity for long-term cure.
