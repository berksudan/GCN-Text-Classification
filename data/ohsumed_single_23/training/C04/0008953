Long survival and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma.
 We studied survival and prognostic factors in all cases of hepatocellular carcinoma seen at a Midwestern teaching hospital from 1947 through 1986.
 Of the 70 cases, 56 were diagnosed during life and 14 at autopsy.
 There were 47 males and 23 females with age at diagnosis ranging from 14 to 88.
 Median survival for the 56 patients diagnosed during life was 106 days.
 Only 11 patients lived longer than one year.
 Two patients were long survivors and presumed cured, one living 27 years after diagnosis and surgical treatment and the other 19 years.
 Cox regression model showed young age at diagnosis and low stage of disease at diagnosis to be significant predictors of long survival.
 White patients survived nearly twice as long as black patients but the difference was not significant.
 Gender and year of diagnosis did not appear to be important determinants of survival.
 Pathologic material was still available for one of the two long survivors and the histology was that of fibrolamellar carcinoma of young adults.
