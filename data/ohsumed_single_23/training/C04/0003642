Leiomyoma of a digital artery.
 Benign, soft-tissue masses of the hand are common.
 A vascular leiomyoma is an unusual tumor of smooth-muscle origin.
 In a 62-year-old man, the tumor arose from within a digital artery.
 Persistent symptoms prompted an excisional biopsy, requiring resection of a portion of the artery.
 Adequate collateral circulation preempted the need for a vascular graft.
 Vascular repair or grafting may be necessary if collateral circulation is not adequate.
