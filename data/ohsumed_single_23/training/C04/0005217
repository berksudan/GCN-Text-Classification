Neoadjuvant Cis-DDP in esophageal cancers: an experience at a regional cancer centre, India.
 We are analysing the results of 80 patients who underwent surgery during 1983-84 for esophageal cancer.
 Forty patients who received pre-operative single agent Cis-DDP were grouped under "A" and 40 patients who went for surgery directly were grouped under "B".
 Twenty-two patients (55%) of Group A showed tumor necrosis.
 Both groups underwent resection and hand-sewn anastamosis of the esophagus.
 There were 10 post-operative deaths among 80 resected cases, 9 of them being from anastomatic leak.
 Cis-DDP has induced negligible side effects.
 A comparatively high survival rate during early years in patients who responded to Cis-DDP suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy might be of value.
