Characteristics of duodenal wall gastrinomas.
 Fifteen patients with duodenal wall gastrinomas (DWGs) and the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have been treated since 1960.
 In 6 of 11 patients, DWGs were recognized at operation and totally excised.
 In four patients, the tumor was subsequently found in the proximal duodenum of the surgical specimens.
 In 12 patients, DWGs were single and lymph node metastases were present in 8.
 In three patients, DWGs were multiple and lymph node metastases were present in two.
 All DWGs were submucosal and all were located in the first or second portions of the duodenum except one found in the fourth portion.
 Tumor size ranged from 1 to 15 mm, and nine were less than 5 mm.
 Of 12 patients with single DWGs, 9 have remained eugastrinemic after resection (mean follow-up: 5.5 years).
 None of the patients with multiple DWGs became eugastrinemic after surgery.
 DWGs are characteristically single, small or microscopic, submucosal, located in the proximal duodenum, rarely metastasize to the liver, and are usually curable by surgical resection.
