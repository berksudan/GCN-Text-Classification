Management of local and regional recurrence after mastectomy or breast-conserving treatment.
 Locoregional failures after primary treatment for breast cancer include a diverse group of lesions that represent different categories of failures with various prognoses.
 Although patients with chest wall recurrences and regional nodal failures after traditional radical surgery have a poor prognosis, many patients can still achieve a significant degree of palliation and even long-term survival or cure with carefully orchestrated multimodal treatment.
 In patients who have breast failures after breast-conservation surgery and radiation, long-term salvage and cure can be achieved for the majority with prompt detection and appropriate treatment, which, like treatment for primary breast cancer, includes a consideration not only of local control but also of the risk of subsequent systemic failure and its need for treatment.
