Inhibition of tumor growth in a glioma model treated with boron neutron capture therapy.
 This investigation attempts to determine whether increased survival time seen when the F98 glioma model is treated with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a result of inhibition of tumor growth caused by radiation-induced alterations in endothelial cells and normal tissue components.
 This indirect effect of radiation has been called the tumor bed effect.
 A series of tumor-bearing rats was studied, using a standardized investigational BNCT protocol consisting of 50 mg/kg of Na2B12H11SH injected intravenously 14 to 17 hours before neutron irradiation at 4 x 10(12) n/cm2.
 Ten rats, serving as controls, received no treatment either before or after tumor implantation.
 A second group of 10 rats was treated with BNCT 4 days before tumor implantation; these animals received no further treatment.
 The remaining group of 10 rats received no pretreatment but was treated with BNCT 10 days after implantation.
 Histological and ultrastructural analyses were performed in 2 animals from each group 17 days after implantation.
 Survival times of the untreated control animals (mean, 25.8 days) did not differ statistically from the survival times of the rats in the pretreated group (mean, 25.5 days).
 The rats treated with BNCT after implantation survived significantly longer (P less than 0.02; mean, 33.2 days) than the controls and the preirradiated animals.
 Tumor size indices calculated from measurements taken at the time of death were similar in all groups.
 These results indicate that, with this tumor model, BNCT does not cause a tumor bed effect in cerebral tissue.
 The therapeutic gains observed with BNCT result from direct effects on tumor cells or on the peritumoral neovascularity.
