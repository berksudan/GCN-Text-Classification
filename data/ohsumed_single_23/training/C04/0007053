Improving diagnostic accuracy of cervical metastases with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.
 Elective neck dissection in patients with head and neck cancer continues to be controversial.
 The management of these patients would be greatly facilitated by improvements in predicting cervical metastases.
 Recent investigations have suggested that computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are more sensitive in detecting cervical metastases than physical examination.
 The Department of Otolaryngology at the Ohio State University Hospitals, Columbus, undertook a prospective study to compare the preoperative sensitivities of physical examination, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging with pathologic findings in 27 patients undergoing neck dissections for head and neck cancer.
 The results indicate that computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were more sensitive (84% and 92%, respectively) than physical examination (75%), although the results did not achieve statistical significance.
 The sensitivity of combined computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging was 90%.
