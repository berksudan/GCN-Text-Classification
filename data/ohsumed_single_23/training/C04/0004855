Immunoscintigraphy of ovarian cancer with indium-111-labeled OV-TL 3 F(ab')2 monoclonal antibody.
 The safety and diagnostic accuracy of immunoscintigraphy with the indium-111-labeled monoclonal antibody OV-TL 3 F(ab')2(111In-OV-TL 3 F(ab')2) for diagnosis and follow-up of ovarian cancer was prospectively studied in 31 patients.
 Planar and SPECT scintigraphy were performed up to 4 days after i.v.
 injection of 140 MBq 111In-OV-TL 3 F(ab')2.
 Surgical evaluation was possible in 22 out of 31 patients.
 Imaging results were compared with X-ray computed tomography, ultrasound, and CA 125 serum level using the histologically confirmed surgical findings as a "gold standard." Apart from a transient rash observed in two patients, no other immediate or delayed adverse reactions were observed.
 Within the surgically evaluated group, ovarian cancer lesions were detected in 16 out of 17 patients (94%).
 Of 45 distinct tumor deposits found at operation, 67% were detected and localized with immunoscintigraphy while X-ray computed tomography and ultrasound visualized 53% and 23%, respectively.
