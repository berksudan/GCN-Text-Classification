Debulking of pelvic and para-aortic lymph node metastases in ovarian cancer with the cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator.
 Six patients with metastatic ovarian cancer with extensive involvement of the pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes underwent surgical debulking with the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator.
 Intraoperative and postoperative morbidity was minimal.
 It is suggested that this technique may be used for cytoreductive surgery in combination with standard surgical techniques.
