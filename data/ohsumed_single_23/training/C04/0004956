Laparoscopic management of ovarian cysts.
 One hundred two women with ovarian cysts were managed laparoscopically over a 13-year period.
 Thirteen were treated with laparoscopic inspection followed by laparotomy, 6 with laparoscopic fine needle aspiration followed by laparotomy and 83 with laparoscopic fenestration and biopsy, with or without coagulation or removal of the cyst lining.
 Satisfactory results were noted in patients treated completely with laparoscopy.
 Only 1 of 56 functional, simple or paraovarian cysts recurred during the study period.
 Two of the 18 ovarian endometriomas treated with fenestration and coagulation or removal of the lining recurred, whereas 8 of 9 such lesions recurred when treated with fenestration alone.
 There were no surgical complications.
