Multicentric endobronchial granular cell myoblastoma.
 Granular cell myoblastoma (GCM) is a rare benign neoplasm involving the tracheobronchial tree.
 It is believed to arise from the Schwann cell.
 Four cases of tracheobronchial GCM, all of which were multicentric, are presented and a conservative therapeutic approach is suggested.
