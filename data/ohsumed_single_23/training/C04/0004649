Cytomegalovirus in the brain: in vitro infection of human brain-derived cells.
 Models for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) brain infection have been developed in a variety of brain-derived cells in which the factors governing virus infectivity might be studied in vitro.
 Studies were initiated with brain endothelial cells, the likely portal of entry for virus into the central nervous system.
 Primary explant cultures of brain endothelial cells, derived from homogenates of healthy human brain, supported complete viral gene expression and cytopathic effect (CPE).
 Endothelial cells do not appear to be a barrier for HCMV passage into the central nervous system.
 Astroglial lines (primary explant or tumor-derived) varied in their ability to support HCMV replication.
 Some (T98G) supported incomplete (immediate-early) gene expression while others (A-172) did not support any detectable gene expression.
 Some astroglial lines (HS-683) supported extensive virus replication with minimal viral CPE.
 Neuronal cell lines (SK-N-MC) were fully permissive.
 The more differentiated glial lines (astrocytoma) were fully permissive to HCMV infection; however, the less differentiated glial lines (glioblastoma) were partly or nonpermissive.
