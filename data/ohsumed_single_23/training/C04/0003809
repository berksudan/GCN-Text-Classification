Primary non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma of the esophagus. A case with peculiar endoscopic ultrasonographic pattern.
 We report a case of primary esophageal non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma in a young white female.
 At admission, endoscopy revealed large, irregularly shaped, esophageal ulcerations with super imposed candidiasis.
 Endoscopic ultrasonography to assess submucosal alterations and periesophageal involvement revealed a diffuse hypoechogenic thickening (up to 5 mm) of the esophageal wall, a pattern consistent with lymphomatous infiltration.
 Definitive diagnosis was made with the aid of histology and immunohistochemistry.
