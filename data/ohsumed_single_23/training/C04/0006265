Breast cancer and dietary and plasma concentrations of carotenoids and vitamin A.
 A case-control study of breast cancer was conducted in Buffalo.
 Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire and donated a fasting blood sample before definitive workup for breast masses.
 Dietary and plasma concentrations of carotenoids and retinol for 83 women found to have breast cancer were compared with those of 113 women found to be free of breast cancer (control subjects).
 There were no case-control differences in dietary estimates of vitamin A intake or in plasma alpha-carotene and lycopene.
 However, subjects with breast cancer had lower concentrations of plasma beta-carotene than did control subjects (P = 0.02).
 There was no overall association between plasma retinol and breast cancer but a positive relationship was observed between retinol and breast cancer in the subgroup with low beta-carotene values.
 These results suggest that low plasma beta-carotene is associated with increased risk of breast cancer.
 Other studies will need to determine whether low carotene concentrations are a subtle effect of the disease or might be causally related to breast cancer.
