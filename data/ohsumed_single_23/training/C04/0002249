Uneventful delivery following series of successive treatments for virilized Cushing syndrome due to adrenocortical carcinoma.
 A twenty-one-year-old virilized woman with Cushing syndrome due to a huge adrenocortical carcinoma was successively treated with trilostane (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor), subsequent adrenalectomy, and postoperative cis-platinum.
 Clinical or biochemical abnormalities peculiar to Cushing syndrome gradually subsided, and three and one-half years after the adrenal surgery, the patient delivered a normal female infant.
 This study points out some of the clinical and biochemical responses of each treatment.
