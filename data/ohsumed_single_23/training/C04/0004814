Intraperitoneal yttrium-90-labeled monoclonal antibody in ovarian cancer 
 From March 1987 to March 1988, a phase I to II study was carried out in 25 patients with ovarian cancer.
 They received escalating doses of intraperitoneally (IP) administered yttrium-90 (Y-90)-labeled monoclonal antibody, HMFG1, against a tumor cell-surface antigen.
 Myelosuppression prevented an escalation of the administered Y-90 activity above 25 mCi.
 Y-90-labeled antibody was absorbed from the peritoneal cavity into the circulation.
 Maximum blood Y-90 activity was observed 40 hours after the IP injection with a mean of 21% of the injected activity (range, 14.2% to 26.4%) in the circulation.
 The radiation dose the bone marrow received from circulating Y-90-labeled antibody (the blood radiation dose) was calculated by applying the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) formulation to the measured Y-90 activity in patients blood.
 Myelosuppression occurred following calculated blood radiation doses to bone marrow of only 10 to 30 cGy.
 The excessive myelosuppression following such modest radiation doses from circulating Y-90-labeled antibody could be explained by the uptake of Y-90 by bone.
 In an attempt to reduce bone absorption of Y-90, seven patients received an intravenous (IV) infusion of EDTA (Sinclair Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Godalming, United Kingdom).
 This increased the urinary excretion of Y-90 from a mean of 11.1% to 32.3% of the injected activity (P = .0001).
 Fourteen patients had assessable tumor at laparoscopy.
 Tumor regression was observed in one patient, and palliation of ascites in a further patient.
