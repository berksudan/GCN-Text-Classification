Effective ultraviolet irradiation of platelet concentrates in teflon bags.
 Several plastic materials used in blood storage were evaluated for their ability to transmit ultraviolet B (UVB) light.
 A plastic bag manufactured from sheets of transparent Teflon efficiently (78-86%) transmitted UVB light and was employed in subsequent functional studies of lymphocytes and platelets exposed to UVB light while contained in these bags.
 In vitro experiments showed a UVB dose-dependent abrogation of lymphocyte responder and stimulator functions, with concurrent preservation of platelet aggregation responses.
 In a phase I pilot study, UVB-treated platelet concentrates were administered to four bone marrow transplant recipients.
 Adverse effects attributable to the transfusions were not observed, and patients showed clinically effective transfusion responses.
 No patient developed lymphocytotoxic HLA or platelet antibodies.
 These studies suggest that platelets can be effectively irradiated with UVB light in a closed system.
 However, numerous variables, including container material, volume and composition of contents, steady exposure versus agitation, and exact UV wavelength, must be considered.
