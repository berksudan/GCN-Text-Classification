The justification for surgical treatment of metastatic melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract.
 Fifty-six patients with symptomatic metastatic melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) treated surgically at the Sydney Melanoma Unit between 1974 and 1989 were reviewed.
 The majority of these patients presented with abdominal pain or symptoms of anemia.
 The small intestine was the site of metastasis in more than 80 per cent.
 The mean over-all survival time was 11.7 months (range of one to 60 months) after surgical treatment of a first metastasis to the GIT and 3.6 months (range of zero to 12 months) postoperatively for a second GIT metastasis.
 Forty-four of the patients reported complete relief of their symptoms postoperatively.
 The results suggest that an aggressive approach to symptomatic GIT metastases from malignant melanoma is justified both to relieve distressing symptoms and to prolong life.
