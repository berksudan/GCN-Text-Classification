Pedunculated giant lipoma of the esophagus.
 A patient with a giant lipoma of the esophagus presented with progressive dysphagia and odynophagia, fever, and recurrent melena.
 Two years previously, when the symptoms were less pronounced, it had been misdiagnosed as achalasia.
 After surgical removal of the lipoma, the patient became symptom free.
