 Cutaneous surgery in 34 pregnant women is described.
 The main indication for surgery was the diagnosis and/or treatment of malignancy.
 Surgery during the period of organogenesis (15 to 56 days) should be avoided when possible.
 Patients should be positioned on the left side during the procedure to avoid the supine hypotensive syndrome.
 Monitoring of the fetal heartbeat is desirable.
 Local anesthetics, penicillin, and erythromycin are safe if used carefully.
 Acetaminophen is the analgesic of choice.
