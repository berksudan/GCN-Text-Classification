Treatment of fallopian tube carcinoma with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide.
 Primary carcinoma of the fallopian tube is uncommon and is often treated using regimens active in ovarian carcinoma.
 Evidence is scant that such therapies benefit patients with fallopian tube carcinoma.
 Between December 1979 and July 1988, we treated 18 patients who had adenocarcinoma of the fallopian tube with the combination of cisplatin (50 mg/m2), doxorubicin (50 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) administered intravenously on 1 day every 28 days.
 Histologic confirmation of fallopian tube carcinoma was obtained before entry in the study.
 Three patients had stage I disease, five had stage II, nine had stage III, and one had stage IV.
 Sixteen patients received the combination therapy as first-line treatment after cytoreductive surgery, and two patients received it for recurrent carcinoma.
 Seven patients had clinically measurable disease at the start of therapy.
 Two of these patients had a complete clinical response, two had stable disease, and three had progressive disease.
 Eight of the 15 patients with stages II-IV disease underwent second-look laparotomy; four had a complete response to therapy and four had a partial response, making the overall response rate 53%.
 The toxicity of the regimen was moderate.
 The median survival was 81 months.
 Patients with stages II-IV disease had a median survival of 43.9 months and a progression-free survival of 22.5 months.
 This regimen appears to be active in fallopian tube carcinoma and can result in response rates comparable to those reported for epithelial ovarian cancer.
