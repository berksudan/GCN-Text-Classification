Successful Fontan-type operation for a nonresectable right ventricular tumor.
 A large intracavitary right ventricular tumor in a 24-year-old patient was considered nonresectable because it involved the interventricular septum, the free ventricular walls, and the tricuspid valve.
 Surgical palliation consisted of closure of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, and the right atrium was anastomosed to the pulmonary artery bifurcation.
 The patient is asymptomatic 7 years after operation, and the neoplasm (a rhabdomyoma) has not increased in size.
