Limbal autograft reconstruction after conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma.
 Two patients who had squamous cell carcinoma with extensive limbal and corneal involvement were treated with surgery and cryotherapy.
 Rarely large areas of the cornea are involved by this tumor.
 Visual prognosis in such patients is poor.
 In these two patients, autologous limbal transplants were effective in restoring an excellent corneal surface and good visual function.
 This technique may be useful in the reconstruction of eyes with extensive neoplastic involvement of the corneoscleral limbus and cornea.
