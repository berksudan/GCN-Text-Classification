The effect of somatostatin on 5-hydroxytryptamine release from a carcinoid tumor.
 One of the major manifestations of the carcinoid syndrome is secretory diarrhea thought to be due to overproduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT).
 Synthetic somatostatin analogues have proved to be clinically effective in controlling this diarrhea.
 We have established a continuous cell line from a human pancreatic carcinoid tumor that secretes 5-HT.
 We examined the ability of the somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995, to inhibit 5-HT release in vitro.
 Tumor cells were exposed to SMS 201-995 (10(-6) mol/L), pentagastrin (10(-9) mol/L), acetylcholine (10(-5) mol/L), and isoproterenol (10(-5) mol/L) alone and in combination; 5-HT release was assayed with high pressure liquid chromatography.
 We found that pentagastrin (6.43 +/- 0.64 ng/ml), isoproterenol (20.24 +/- 2.17 ng/ml), and acetylcholine (12.39 +/- 1.10 ng/ml) each stimulated release of 5-HT compared to control values (4.38 +/- 0.42 ng/ml).
 SMS 201-995 significantly reduced release of 5-HT in response to isoproterenol and acetylcholine but did not inhibit the effect of pentagastin.
 These data suggest that different agents do not act through the same pathway to stimulate 5-HT release from human pancreatic carcinoid cells.
