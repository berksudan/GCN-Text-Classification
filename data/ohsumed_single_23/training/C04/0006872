Mediastinal hibernoma, a rare tumor.
 Hibernoma is an uncommon soft tissue tumor that is derived from the remnants of fetal brown fat.
 Review of the world medical literature revealed 90 cases, 6 of which were intrathoracic.
 We present the seventh case of intrathoracic hibernoma; in this case, the hibernoma was within the mediastinum without direct invasion of other structures.
