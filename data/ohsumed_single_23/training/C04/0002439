Endoscopic ultrasonography in staging rectal cancer.
 Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was used to stage rectal cancer by assessing depth of invasion through bowel wall layers and/or involvement of lymph nodes.
 EUS findings were correlated with histopathologic findings to discern the usefulness of this modality in predicting which patients could be candidates for sphinctersaving procedures and the avoidance of abdominoperineal resection.
 The Olympus EU-M3 endoscopic ultrasound system was used to assess depth of penetration through rectal wall layers and to identify lymph nodes.
 Comparison of EUS findings to histopathologic findings was possible in 13 patients.
 EUS agreed with histopathology in 9 of 13 cases (69.3%) ( p = 0.07, kappa statistic).
 EUS agreed with histopathology as the presence or absence of lymph nodes in 9 of 13 cases (69.3%) (p = 0.07).
 However, the presence of lymph nodes could not necessarily predict metastatic involvement of these nodes.
 In one patient, invasion of vaginal cuff was correctly predicted.
 In nine cases, computed tomographic analysis (CT) was available for comparison to EUS in detection of penetration beyond the bowel wall.
 CT agreed with histopathology in 3 of 9 (33%), whereas EUS agreed with histopathology in 7 of 9 (78%).
