Surgical treatment of cardiac myxomas: long-term results.
 Between 1965 and 1988, 22 patients underwent 24 operations for cardiac myxomas.
 Two patients had the complex myxoma syndrome.
 Mitral valve replacement was required at initial operation in 2 patients.
 One patient died perioperatively, and 5 others died subsequently.
 The 16 surviving patients recently underwent evaluation at a mean duration of 9 years after operation.
 Ten are asymptomatic and 6 have New York Heart Association class II symptoms.
 Nine patients continue to be employed.
 Eleven are in sinus rhythm, 3 have permanent pacemakers, and 2 have chronic atrial arrhythmias.
 Echocardiography showed atrioventricular valve insufficiency in 3 patients and reduced contractility in 4, but no new tumor recurrences.
 The long-term prognosis of this relatively large group of patients with cardiac myxomas has been good.
 Patients without the complex myxoma syndrome had no recurrence, whereas 2 patients did require reoperation for mitral valve replacement.
 Long-term disability and chronic arrhythmias have been infrequent, and functional status and employability of these patients have been very good.
