Survey of Alabama physicians' use of mammography, 1989.
 In early 1989 we surveyed by questionnaire Alabama primary care physicians (N = 1800) concerning their attitudes toward and use of mammography.
 There were 681 respondents (37.8%).
 The majority (83%) recommend mammograms for their patients according to the American Cancer Society guidelines and obtain baseline studies in asymptomatic women between the ages of 35 and 40 years.
 It appears that the cost of mammograms is decreasing in Alabama; a screening study was available for $50 or less to 34% of responding physicians.
 Almost one half (48%) of the physician respondents believe that more than 50% of their patients have had at least one mammogram.
