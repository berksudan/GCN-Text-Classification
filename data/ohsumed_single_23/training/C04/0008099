Modified Van Nes rotationplasty for osteosarcoma of the proximal tibia in children 
 Above-knee amputation has been the traditional treatment for osteosarcoma of the proximal tibia.
 Recent advances in chemotherapy have encouraged the development of limb-salvage techniques.
 Van Nes rotationplasty for malignant lesions of the distal femur has increased in popularity as a reconstructive technique, but no similar procedure has been described for lesions of the proximal tibia.
 We have developed a modified rotationplasty for this lesion and have performed it in four children.
 The surgical technique, postoperative management and results of the procedure are described.
 Two patients had delayed wound healing.
 No other complications have developed and our patients were disease-free at follow-up, while the appearance of the leg was well accepted by the patients and their parents.
 This procedure is a useful addition to the armamentarium of the tumour surgeon for the treatment of malignant lesions of the proximal tibia.
