The interplay of local and distant control in the cure of cervical cancer.
 From 1978 to 1986, 183 women with cervical cancer received definitive radiation therapy after extraperitoneal surgical staging.
 Relapse-free rates were strong functions of pelvic lymph node metastases and cervical size.
 The recurrence distribution consisted of 4% isolated local, 13% isolated distant, and 17% combined local and distant failures.
 With the assumption of independent local and distant failure probabilities, Suit et al.'s method was extended to assess potential improvement in cure attainable with perfect local and distant control, yielding local (LSA) and distant (DSA) survival advantages of 17% and 28%.
 Various subsets of clinical stage, cervical size, pelvic node metastases, periaortic metastases, and peritoneal metastases had LSA from 12% to 27% and DSA from 12% to 71%.
 For any prognostic group, LSA never exceeded DSA, showing that effective systemic therapy would have a greater impact on improving survival than would advances in local and regional tumor control.
 Therapeutic implications and limitations of the extended LSA-DSA model are discussed.
 This form of analysis can be used to guide the intensity of local and distant treatment to maximize the cure of the patient with cancer.
