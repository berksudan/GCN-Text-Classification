Selective nonoperative management of patients referred with abnormal mammograms.
 Screening mammography provides a means of detecting clinically occult breast carcinoma, but the question of whether all abnormal mammograms require biopsy remains unanswered.
 We retrospectively reviewed records of 214 women referred over an 8-year period for abnormal mammograms.
 They were selectively assigned to biopsy or mammographic follow-up based on specific mammographic criteria.
 Of 114 women initially observed mammographically, 2 were later found by biopsy to have carcinoma.
 Initial assignment to mammographic observation delayed the recommendation for biopsy 3 and 12 months, respectively, in these patients, but no effect on outcome was documented.
 Because they have benign lesions by clinical and mammographic criteria, 102 women (53%) have been spared biopsy; they continue to be monitored closely.
 We believe these data support the use of a selective approach to biopsy based on specific mammographic criteria.
