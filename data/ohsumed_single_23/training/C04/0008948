Cryoprobe as a "handle" for resection of metastatic liver tumors.
 Resection of metastatic liver tumors can be a difficult and risky procedure.
 Using a cryoprobe as a "handle" can greatly facilitate resection by providing a taut surface for transection and improving visualization of ductal and vascular structures.
 In addition, this technique may decrease the risk of contaminating surrounding tissues with cancer cells, and may inhibit tumor recurrence within the margins of resection.
