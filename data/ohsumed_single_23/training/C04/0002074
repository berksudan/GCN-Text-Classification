Malignant melanoma and pigmented lesions: a diagnostic and management dilemma.
 We document two cases of malignancy occurring at the site of partially removed benign nevi.
 Because of the difficulty in clinical diagnosis and the uncertainty in its behavior, we propose that any recurring melanocytic nevus expanding beyond the original surgical scar be re-excised and the specimen carefully analyzed to ensure complete removal.
