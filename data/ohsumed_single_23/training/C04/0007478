Invasive papillary carcinoma of the breast: mammographic appearance.
 The mammographic findings in 18 patients with invasive papillary carcinoma were studied retrospectively.
 The mammograms of 10 patients showed a multinodular pattern, and seven patients had solitary nodules.
 One patient had an irregular, ill-defined mass in the retroareolar region.
 Two patients were found to have carcinoma in the contralateral breast, and two patients had intraductal carcinoma adjacent to the invasive papillary carcinoma.
 The varied mammographic features that may occur with this rare breast malignancy are discussed.
