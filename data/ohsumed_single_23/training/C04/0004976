Oral zidovudine, continuous-infusion fluorouracil, and oral leucovorin calcium: a phase I study.
 A phase I clinical, pharmacologic, and biochemical evaluation of escalating oral zidovudine (AZT) given over 2 days with a fixed dose of continuous-infusion fluorouracil (800 mg/m2 per day X 3 days) and oral leucovorin calcium was performed.
 Eighteen patients were treated with doses of AZT ranging from 1.0 to 9.0 g/m2 per day.
 Nausea and vomiting were dose limiting, with a maximally tolerated dose of 7.5 g/m2 per day.
 Rash and mucositis occurred but were not dose limiting.
 A dose-related increase in peak plasma levels of AZT was observed, and the alpha half-life of AZT in plasma (75 min) was unaffected by these high doses.
 At doses above 4.0 g/m2 per day, trough levels significantly increased, perhaps reflecting prolonged absorption from the gut.
 No responses were observed; however, a significant increase in DNA single-strand breaks was observed in peripheral blood cells after a threshold dose of 4.0 g/m2 per day, confirming a biological effect of AZT in this regimen.
 Further trials with an intravenous formulation capable of maintaining plasma levels and circumventing dose-limiting toxicity are warranted.
