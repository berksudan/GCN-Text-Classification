Multiple spinal metastases from paraganglioma.
 Isolated vertebral body metastases from paraganglioma are exceedingly rare.
 They have been reported to occur in the presence of active primary tumor in the neck, local recurrence, or widespread metastases.
 A unique case of carotid body tumor (paraganglioma) is reported with the following features: (1) multiple vertebral body metastases (C6, T9, and L3) presenting with spinal cord compression, and no evidence of local recurrence or other metastatic disease; (2) absence of mitoses on the original specimen or the metastatic deposit; and (3) a prolonged interval (9 years) to the development of symptomatic metastases.
