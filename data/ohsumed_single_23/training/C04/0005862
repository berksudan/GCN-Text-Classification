A prospective clinical evaluation of autogenous vein grafts used as a nerve conduit for distal sensory nerve defects of 3 cm or less.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of autogenous vein grafts as nerve grafts (AVNC) for bridging of small peripheral sensory nerve gaps as compared with direct repair and with conventional nerve grafting techniques (ANG).
 Patients with painful neuroma or segmental nerve injury of 3 cm were chosen as the test group.
 Those amenable to direct repair were classified as controls.
 Between 1982 to 1988, a total of 22 patients were enrolled in this study.
 A total of 34 nerves were repaired, 15 with a venous nerve conduit, 4 with a sural nerve graft, and 15 with direct repair.
 Significant symptom relief and satisfactory sensory function return were uniformly observed.
 The two-point discrimination measurements indicated superiority of direct repair and probably of conventional nerve grafting.
 However, the universally favorable patient acceptance and the return of measurable two-point discrimination indicates the effectiveness of autogenous vein grafts as nerve conduits when selectively applied to bridge a small nerve gap (less than or equal to 3 cm) on nonessential peripheral sensory nerves.
