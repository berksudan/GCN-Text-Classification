Carcinoma of the external auditory canal: an update.
 This review is a continuation of the series of 35 cases of carcinoma of the external auditory canal originally reported by the senior author and colleagues.
 Eighteen additional cases have been evaluated and treated since 1976.
 Preoperative high-resolution computed tomographic scanning has replaced polytomography, and improved surgical skull base approaches have allowed for extended resections of advanced lesions.
 A revised classification for local and extensive lesions is presented.
 The prognosis for localized tumors treated by en bloc resection remains excellent, whereas prognosis for extensive lesions might be more dependent on histologic type and grade of tumor.
