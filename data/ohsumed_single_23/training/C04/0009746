The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. A functionally viable reconstructive procedure in children who have a tumor of the distal end of the femur.
 Twelve patients who had a malignant tumor of the distal end of the femur were treated with a Van Nes tibial rotationplasty.
 The survival rates were comparable with those for above-the-knee amputees and patients who had an endoprosthetic replacement.
 The results of functional testing showed that these patients performed as well as those who had endoprosthetic replacement and better than those who had above-the-knee amputation.
 Rotationplasty is therefore a favorable alternative to amputation or endoprosthetic replacement, either as a primary or as a salvage procedure.
