Total pelvic exenteration with simultaneous bowel and urinary reconstruction.
 The technique of total pelvic exenteration with simultaneous bowel and urinary reconstruction is described as a surgical option for the management of pelvic sarcoma in adults and for highly selected patients with other types of advanced pelvic malignancy.
 The surgical technique is presented in detail as performed in a 43-year-old man who presented with extensive primitive pelvic sarcoma.
 We believe that this approach may provide the benefits of an exenterative operation without the undesirable psychosocial sequelae of a permanent colostomy and external urinary diversion.
