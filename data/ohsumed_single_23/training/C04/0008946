Effects of FUdR on primary-cultured colon carcinomas metastatic to the liver.
 Hepatic arterial infusion of fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma of the liver.
 In this study, the direct cytotoxic effect of FUdR was measured on ten metastatic and two primary-site colorectal carcinomas in a primary culture assay system.
 Overall, clinically achievable concentrations of FUdR (0.4 to 4 microM) induced partial cell kill in 75% of tumors, including a greater than 50% reduction in viable tumor cell number in only two tumors and less than 50% in the remaining seven.
 Total cell kill was not observed in any tumor.
 Three tumors were resistant to these FUdR concentrations.
 Tumor sensitivity correlated with the size of the tumor growth fraction.
 Increasing the exposure time to FUdR from 3 to 7 days approximately doubled the magnitude of the response.
 5-Flurouracil and cisplatin, at clinically achievable concentrations, were more toxic to metastatic tumor cells than FUdR.
 Because of the limited chemosensitivity of metastatic colorectal tumor cells to FUdR in vitro, we postulate that other mechanisms besides direct cytotoxicity contribute to the clinical efficacy of FUdR in vivo.
