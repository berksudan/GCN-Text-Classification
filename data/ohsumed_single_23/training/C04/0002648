Multimodality preoperative treatment for advanced stage IV (MO) cancer of the head and neck.
 Sixty-three patients with advanced unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.
 We observed a 75% response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
 The 5-year survival rate for all 63 patients was 20%, and only 3 patients were alive at 8 years.
 The 5-year survival rate for patients who completed the treatment plan and received chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery was 43% compared with 20% for those who had chemotherapy and radiation but refused surgery.
 Development of a second primary cancer was the cause of death in 62% of the patients who survived more than 24 months.
