Immediate versus delayed shoulder exercises after axillary lymph node dissection.
 A total of 144 evaluable patients with breast cancer were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, prospective study to establish the role of delayed shoulder exercises on wound drainage and shoulder function after axillary lymph node dissection.
 Patients in group 1 (n = 78) started active shoulder exercises 1 day postoperatively.
 Patients in group 2 (n = 66) started on the eight postoperative day, following 1 week of immobilization of the arm.
 Patients in group 2 had 14% less wound drainage volume than those in group 1 (600 +/- 436 mL versus 701 +/- 398 mL); this difference, however, was not significant.
 Also, no differences could be established between the two groups when duration and volume of wound drainage, number and volume of seroma aspirations, wound complication rates, and shoulder function were compared 6 months after surgery.
