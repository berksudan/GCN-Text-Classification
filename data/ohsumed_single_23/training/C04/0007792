Melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma in seven patients.
 Seven patients with both melanoma and sarcoma were seen at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA) over a 4-year period.
 Three had additional malignant neoplasms; one of these patients also had the hereditary cutaneous malignant melanoma, dysplastic nevus syndrome.
 These observations suggest the possibility of a biologic relationship between melanoma and sarcoma, the nature of which remains unknown.
