Late development of a squamous carcinoma in a reconstructed pharynx.
 We report a case in which a squamous cell carcinoma was found to have arisen from a delto-pectoral skin flap used in pharyngeal reconstruction.
 The flap had been forming a neo-pharynx for 24 years.
 No other signs of recurrent disease had developed in this period.
 This raises the possibility of tumour induction in heterotopic skin used for oropharyngeal reconstruction.
