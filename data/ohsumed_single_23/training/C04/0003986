Detection of duodenal gastrinomas by operative endoscopic transillumination. A prospective study.
 The ability of operative endoscopic transillumination of the bowel wall to detect duodenal gastrinoma was evaluated prospectively in 26 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
 The results were assessed by exploratory laparotomy and compared with the results of other localization techniques.
 Twelve duodenal gastrinomas were resected from 10 patients.
 Operative endoscopic transillumination detected 10 of the 12 gastrinomas, a sensitivity of 83%, which was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than that for either preoperative imaging (25%) or intraoperative ultrasonography and palpation (42%).
 The sensitivity of operative endoscopic transillumination was a result of the ability to detect focal areas that did not transilluminate on the serosal side of the duodenum, and not the mucosal appearances seen through the endoscope, which were not helpful.
 Operative endoscopic transillumination detected gastrinomas less than 1 cm in diameter throughout the duodenum.
 Of the patients in this study, 39% had duodenal gastrinomas, a greater frequency than previously reported.
 These results indicate that operative endoscopic transillumination is the most sensitive technique yet described for detecting duodenal gastrinomas and should be performed routinely in all patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome who undergo exploratory laparotomy for cure.
