Transfer of secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus: discrimination between homologous and heterologous transfer in intact heterokaryons.
 To examine aspects of the transfer of secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus in situ, heterokaryons were formed between Hep G2 human hepatoma cells and WI-38 human fibroblasts.
 The cells were appropriately treated with cycloheximide before fusion, which emptied them of their respective secretory proteins, serum albumin for the Hep G2 cells and procollagen I for the WI-38 cells.
 After fusion was complete, the cycloheximide was washed out, protein synthesis was resumed, and the rates of reappearance of serum albumin and procollagen I in the two separated Golgi apparatuses within each heterokaryon were followed by immunofluorescence microscopy.
 Serum albumin was found to always reappear first in the Golgi apparatus contributed by the Hep G2 half of the heterokaryon, and procollagen I in the Golgi apparatus of the WI-38 half.
 These results suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi apparatus transfer in situ is not simply a stochastic process but is either spatially restricted or exhibits cell-type specificity or both.
