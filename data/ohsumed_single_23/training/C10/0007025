Neurodevelopmental outcome of children with evidence of periventricular leukomalacia on late MRI.
 Fifteen children, 8 months of age or older, from a neonatal follow-up program underwent magnetic resonance imaging and neurologic, cognitive, and language evaluations.
 Magnetic resonance imaging findings in all children included increased white matter signal on T2-weighted images and ventricular enlargement adjacent to regions of abnormal white matter.
 The extent of degree of abnormal white matter signal and the degree of sulcal prominence were variable.
 Twelve children had cerebral palsy; 5 children, 4 of whom had cerebral palsy, manifested significant sensory impairments.
 The median score on cognitive testing was 89; only 2 children exhibited severe-to-profound cognitive disability.
 Cognitive scores were stable on retesting.
 The degree of motor disability was correlated with the extent of white matter signal abnormality; however, cognitive outcome was not related to the extent and degree of white matter signal abnormality or to the degree of sulcal prominence.
 Despite the association of a major handicapping condition and periventricular leukomalacia, cognitive and language functioning may be relatively spared.
