Glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy prevention by exercise in fast-twitch fibers.
 Exercise has been shown to be effective in preventing glucocorticoid-induced atrophy in muscles containing high proportions of type II or fast-twitch fibers.
 This investigation was undertaken to further evaluate this response in type IIa and IIb fibers, determined by histochemical staining for myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase with alkaline and acid preincubation.
 Steroid [cortisol acetate (CA), 100 mg/kg body wt] and exercise (running 90 min/day, 29 m/min) treatments were initiated simultaneously for 11 consecutive days in female rats.
 Fiber distribution and area measurements were performed in a deep and superficial region of plantaris muscle.
 The exercise regimen spared approximately 40% of the CA-induced plantaris muscle atrophy.
 In the deep region, the fiber population, which contained approximately 13% type I (slow-twitch), 24% type IIa, and 63% IIb fibers, was not affected by either treatment.
 In the superficial section, which consisted solely of type II fibers, the proportion of type IIa fibers was higher (27 vs.
 9%, P less than 0.01) in the steroid- than in the vehicle-treated groups.
 Within each region, type IIa fibers were less susceptible to atrophy than type IIb fibers, and within each fiber type, the deep region had less atrophy than the superficial region.
 Type I fibers were unchanged by steroid treatment.
 For type IIa fibers, exercise prevented 100% of the atrophy in the deep region and 50% in the superficial region.
 For type IIb fibers, the activity spared 67 and 40% of the atrophy in these same regions, respectively.
 These results show that glucocorticoids are capable of changing the myosin phenotype.
