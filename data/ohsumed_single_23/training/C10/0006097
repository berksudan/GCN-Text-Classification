Embolic stroke after smoking "crack" cocaine.
 A 39-year-old woman had an embolic upper division middle cerebral artery branch occlusion 3 hours after smoking the free base of cocaine ("crack").
 Radionuclide ventriculography demonstrated cardiomyopathy, and echocardiography documented a left atrial thrombus.
 This case demonstrates that embolism is one mechanism of ischemic stroke after cocaine use, and that cardiomyopathy, possibly cocaine induced, may be the source of embolus.
 A cardiac source of embolus should be sought in patients with cocaine-associated cerebral infarction.
