Effects of MK-801 on recovery from sensorimotor cortex lesions.
 Histologic evidence suggests that drugs acting as noncompetitive antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor can have beneficial or pathologic effects on central nervous system neurons.
 In the present experiments we examined the effects of MK-801 on recovery of behavioral function after unilateral lesions in the rat somatic sensorimotor cortex.
 In the first experiment, rats with unilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions were given either MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or saline 12-16 hours after surgery.
 Additional injections were given on postoperative days 2, 4, and 6.
 Behavioral tests measured somatosensory asymmetries (i.e., bilateral tactile stimulation tests) and forelimb placing.
 After creation of sensorimotor cortex lesions, rats showed an ipsilateral somatosensory bias and an impairment in placing the contralateral forelimb.
 Rats treated with MK-801 recovered slightly faster than saline-treated animals as measured by a bilateral tactile stimulation test (p less than 0.05).
 In contrast, there was no significant difference between the groups in the recovery of forelimb placing.
 In a second experiment, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions were treated with a single injection of MK-801 after behavioral recovery.
 Twenty hours after the MK-801 injection, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions showed a reinstatement of the placing deficits.
 The impairment endured for at least 7 days after injection.
 These behavioral data support the idea that MK-801 can have either beneficial or detrimental effects when administered after brain damage.
