Neurologic complications of cocaine abuse.
 The neurologic complications of cocaine toxicity are responsible for a major portion of the morbidity and mortality associated with cocaine.
 Most of the complications appear to be related to the hyperadrenergic state induced by cocaine and may be treated symptomatically.
 Diazepam is the most effective drug for cocaine-induced seizures.
