Late juvenile-onset Krabbe's disease.
 Krabbe's disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by a lack of galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase activity.
 In contrast to the classic early infantile-onset form of Krabbe's disease, less recognized, late-onset variants exist.
 The authors present a case of late juvenile-onset Krabbe's disease, including the associated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.
 Most patients with late-onset Krabbe's disease present with visual loss due to optic atrophy.
 Associated gait abnormalities and parental consanguinity should increase the clinician's suspicion that a child may have late-onset Krabbe's disease.
 Because of the prolonged survival in late-onset Krabbe's disease, the recent development of bone marrow transplantation for these patient makes diagnosis of this disorder particularly important.
