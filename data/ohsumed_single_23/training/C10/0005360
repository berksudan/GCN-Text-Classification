A review of techniques employed to estimate the number of motor units in a muscle.
 Being the smallest functional units under neural control, motor units play an integral role in muscle physiology.
 However, at the present time, there does not exist any widely accepted technique for quantifying or estimating the number of motor units in a muscle.
 Specifically, the existing techniques are the increment-counting technique, a technique based on spike-triggered averaging, and a macro-EMG based technique which vary in invasiveness from noninvasive to highly invasive, respectively.
 We discuss each of these techniques, along with their associated shortcomings, in detail.
