Brain protection: physiological and pharmacological considerations. Part I: The physiology of brain injury.
 Ischaemia, whether focal or global in nature, produces a sequence of intracellular events leading to increased cell permeability to water and ions including Ca++.
 There is a loss of cellular integrity and function, with increased production of prostaglandins, free radicals, and acidosis with lactate accumulation.
 These events may be exacerbated by glucose administration.
 Pharmacological agents aimed at alleviating ischaemic injury could be directed at decreasing cerebral metabolic requirements for oxygen, improving flow to ischaemic areas, preventing Ca+(+)-induced injury, inhibition of free radical formation, lactate removal, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, and prevention of complement-mediated leukocyte aggregation.
 Part I of this paper describes some of the pathophysiological events leading to ischaemic brain injury.
 Part 2 of this paper will consider the current agents available for brain protection.
