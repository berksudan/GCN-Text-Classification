An implantable neurocybernetic prosthesis system.
 The neurocybernetic prosthesis (Cyberonics, Inc.) is an implantable, multiprogrammable pulse generator that delivers constant current electrical signals to the vagus nerve for the purpose of reducing the frequency and/or severity of epileptic seizures.
 The device is implanted in a subcutaneous chest pocket just below the clavicle, similar to cardiac pacemaker placement.
 The stimulation signal is transmitted from the prosthesis to the vagus nerve through a stimulation lead.
 The prosthesis can be programmed using any IBM-compatible personal computer with programming software and a programming wand.
 The electrodes used in the first group of patients were found to break at an unacceptable rate.
 Design modifications appear to have resolved this problem.
