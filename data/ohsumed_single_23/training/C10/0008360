Deteriorating ischemic stroke: risk factors and prognosis.
 To determine a risk profile of deterioration in cerebral infarction of less than 8 hours' duration, we studied prospectively a series of clinical and radiologic data in 98 patients.
 We evaluated the Canadian Neurological Scale Score and Barthel index during a follow-up period of 3 months.
 There was deterioration in the 1st 48 hours in 40.8% of the patients.
 High systolic blood pressure, elevated blood sugar concentration at admission, and carotid territory involvement were independently related with deterioration in the logistic regression analysis.
 Death occurred in 35% of the patients with deteriorating infarcts and in 8.6% of those with stable infarcts.
 At the end of the study, functional capacity was lower in those with deteriorating infarcts, but the 2 groups improved in parallel from the 4th day onward.
