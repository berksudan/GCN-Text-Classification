Quantifying language development from birth to 3 years using the Early Language Milestone Scale.
 A point-scoring technique for the Early Language Milestone Scale is described.
 Normative data based on the original 1982 cross-sectional sample and validation data based on a separate longitudinal sample are presented.
 Mean Early Language Milestone Scale point scores, standard deviations, and percentile equivalents for raw point scores are presented for all ages from birth to 36 months.
 Correlations between point scores on the Early Language Milestone Scale and scores on other standardized developmental tests such as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities are presented.
 The clinical and research advantages of this point-scoring technique are presented and compared with the original pass/fail scoring method.
