Familial trigeminal neuralgia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Report of two families and review.
 Typical trigeminal neuralgia has occasionally occurred in multiple members of the same family over several generations.
 The clinical features of such cases, including the increased incidence in females, and the absence of other apparent hereditary, neurologic, metabolic, or structural abnormalities were identical to those of sporadic cases.
 More rarely, familial trigeminal neuralgia has been described in the setting of hereditary peripheral neuropathy, especially Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
 We describe patients from two different families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia.
 Both patients were successfully treated by percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizolysis.
 The occurrence of cranial nerve symptoms in patients with demyelinating peripheral neuropathies is discussed in light of the current hypotheses regarding the etiology of trigeminal neuralgia.
