Does primary fibromyalgia exist? 
 Twenty-one of 25 consecutive primary fibromyalgia or fibrositis patients, identified during a 5-year period in a tertiary care day-ward for pain syndromes, were re-examined.
 Fifteen fulfilled criteria for fibromyalgia but unexpectedly, all cases had either psychiatric disturbance or thyroid dysfunction.
 Of the four patients not seen at follow-up, two had developed neurological diseases, another rheumatoid arthritis and one other hypothyroidism.
 Thus, after 5 years no patient fulfilled the criteria for primary fibromyalgia.
 Women occupied as manual workers were over-represented.
 Most patients reported beneficial effects of physiotherapy.
 None of the patients has been able to return to full time work.
