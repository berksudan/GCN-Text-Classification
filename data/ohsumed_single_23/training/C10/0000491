Myasthenia gravis.
 Myasthenia Gravis is a disorder of neuromuscular function resulting from an immunologically based premature destruction of acetylcholine receptors.
 The disease is characterized clinically by variable weakness accentuated by repetitive muscular activity and usually responding to the administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
 Myasthenia Gravis is a complex disease and requires understanding of the many facets of its natural history and immunological basis to ensure optimal individual patient management.
 The long-term goal is control of the immunological imbalance; treatment regimens include thymectomy, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and plasmapheresis.
 The common use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provides symptomatic relief during variable daily muscular activity.
 Disability due to myasthenia gravis is to a large extent reversible and death is preventable.
 Early recognition of myasthenia gravis and appropriate treatment are often rewarded by remission that may be permanent.
