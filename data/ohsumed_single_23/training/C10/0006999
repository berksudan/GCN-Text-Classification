Temporoparietal cortex in aphasia. Evidence from positron emission tomography.
 Forty-four aphasic patients were examined with (F18)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in a resting state to determine whether consistent glucose metabolic abnormalities were present.
 Ninety-seven percent of subjects showed metabolic abnormalities in the angular gyrus, 89% in the supramarginal gyrus, and 87% in the lateral and transverse superior temporal gyrus.
 Pearson product moment correlations were calculated between regional metabolic measures and performance on the Western Aphasia Battery.
 No significant correlations were found between the Western Aphasia Battery scores and right hemisphere metabolic measures.
 Most left hemisphere regions correlated with more than one score from the Western Aphasia Battery.
 Temporal but not frontal regions had significant correlations to the comprehension score.
 The left temporoparietal region was consistently affected in these subjects, suggesting that common features in the aphasias were caused by left temporoparietal dysfunction, while behavioral differences resulted from (1) the extent of temporoparietal changes, and (2) dysfunction elsewhere in the brain, particularly the left frontal and subcortical areas.
