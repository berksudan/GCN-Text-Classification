Cholinergic deficiency and frontal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
 To investigate the influence of central cholinergic deficit on cognitive function in Parkinson's disease (PD), we compared the neuropsychological performance of a group of 20 patients who were treated with anticholinergic drugs (mean daily dose, 10.2 mg) with that of a group of 20 patients who received no anticholinergics.
 The two groups were matched for all the variables of parkinsonism and levodopa therapy.
 At the dose used, there was no significant difference between the two groups of patients for intellectual, visuospatial, instrumental, and memory function.
 In contrast, in the group that received anticholinergics severe impairment was observed on tests believed to assess frontal lobe function.
 These results suggest that the lesion of the ascending cholinergic neurons, which has been demonstrated post mortem in PD, may play a role in the subcorticofrontal behavioral impairment of this disease.
