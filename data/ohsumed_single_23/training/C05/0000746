Healing of non-vascularised diaphyseal bone transplants. An experimental study.
 Four different experiments were performed to study the healing of a large, non-vascularised, diaphyseal, bone segment in adult cats.
 In the first experiment, a 4 cm segment of tibia with its periosteum was excised and replaced in its bed.
 The other experiments were similar, except that in the second, the periosteum of the segment was removed, in the third its medullary canal was blocked with a Silastic rod, and in the last group the segment was isolated from its muscle bed by a Silastic sheet.
 The reparative processes were quantified by estimating the resorption index, the cortical new bone formation index, the callus encasement index, and the osteocyte count.
 Bone resorption and apposition occurred in the segment even when the periosteum was absent or the medullary canal was blocked, with osseous union at both ends by eight to 12 weeks, provided the segment was not isolated from its muscle bed.
 Thus, the muscle bed played a significant role in these reparative processes.
