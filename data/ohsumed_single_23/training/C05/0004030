Soft tissue rheumatism of the upper extremities: diagnosis and management.
 Upper extremity tendinitis and bursitis are usually the result of repetitive microtrauma, probably resulting in disruption of fibers.
 A focus of inflammation often occurs, producing pain, spasm, and disability.
 With a careful history and physical exam, the diagnosis can be made, distinguishing soft tissue rheumatism from arthritis.
 Treatment consists of rest, heat or ice, and frequently, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or injections to control the inflammatory response.
 Protection from repeated trauma may be beneficial in preventing recurrence.
