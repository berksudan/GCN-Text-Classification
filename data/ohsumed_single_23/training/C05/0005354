Quantitative electromyography in polymyositis: a reappraisal.
 Manual analysis of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) was performed in 33 patients with polymyositis of whom 16 were studied in the acute stage and 17 in the chronic stage.
 Contrary to common description of "myopathic potentials" as being of low amplitude, short duration, and polyphasic shape, the quantitated study revealed no difference as to amplitude of short duration MUAPs in patients and normal subjects though short-duration MUAP and short duration polyphasic potentials were 4 and 3 times, respectively, more common in patients than in controls.
 Although the mean duration of MUAPs usually was significantly shorter in polymyositis than in controls, the average scatter of MUAPs duration was the same in the 2 groups.
 The average incidence of polyphasic MUAPs was 4 times higher in patients than in controls, as was the incidence of those of long duration.
 To avoid misinterpretation of EMG findings due to an excess of polyphasic MUAPs, a greater number of individual potentials than usually recommended should be collected allowing a valid estimate of the mean duration of MUAPs of simple configuration.
