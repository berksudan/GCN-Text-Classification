Bipolar versus total hip arthroplasty for avascular necrosis of the femoral head. A comparison.
 In a relatively small series of cases the results of bipolar prostheses in avascular necrosis were inferior to those of total hip arthroplasty (THA).
 Femoral loosening rates were not reduced by using bipolar prostheses.
 THA produced more inferior results in avascular necrosis than in degenerative joint disease.
 Early results of noncemented THA for avascular necrosis were good but also must withstand the test of time.
 A fixed noncemented acetabular component was preferable over a bipolar prosthesis for avascular necrosis of the femoral head.
