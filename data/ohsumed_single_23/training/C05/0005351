Electrophysiological spectrum of inclusion body myositis.
 We present electrodiagnostic data on 30 patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM) in order to better delineate its electrophysiological features.
 Comprehensive electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were performed in all cases.
 Twelve patients had single fiber electromyography (SFEMG).
 EMG showed abundant short-small motor unit potentials (MUP) with fibrillations and positive sharp waves in 56.6% of patients, and a mixed pattern of large and small MUP in 36.7%.
 In 6.7%, only "neurogenic" features were seen.
 NCS were slow in 33.3%.
 SFEMG revealed a mildly abnormal jitter and a slightly increased fiber density.
 IBM demonstrates a heterogeneous EMG profile.
 A pattern of large and small MUP is highly suggestive of IBM but is seen in only about one third of cases.
