Magnetic resonance imaging and the nonoperative treatment of spinal epidural abscess.
 This report describes three patients with spinal epidural abscess diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and treated nonoperatively.
 Prior to treatment, one patient was neurologically intact, one patient demonstrated a moderate neurological deficit, and one patient was severely paraparetic with loss of bladder and bowel control.
 Following identification of the pathogenic organism, antibiotic therapy was continued until the patients demonstrated clinical improvement and radiological resolution of the abscess.
 All patients remained stable or improved neurologically.
 Analysis of 33 previously reported patients treated with antibiotics suggests that nonoperative treatment may be a reasonable alternative therapy under certain clinical conditions.
 These include (1) identification of the pathogenic organism, (2) a stable neurological condition, (3) access to magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography for potentially rapid reevaluation, and (4) appropriate neurosurgical consultation and nursing care.
 Nonoperative treatment may also be considered as a reasonable alternative for patients who have severe concurrent medical illness.
