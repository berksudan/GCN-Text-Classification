The influence of growth hormone on the reversibility of articular cartilage degeneration in rabbits.
 Growth hormone has chondrogenic affects on normal as well as on damaged articular cartilage.
 In this study, the influence of growth hormone is investigated on early degenerative changes in the articular cartilage in 72 New Zealand white rabbits.
 Cartilage lesions were created in femoral condyles using an immobilization model.
 Cartilage damage was assessed using biochemical, histologic, and biomechanical criteria.
 Growth hormone had no influence on prevention of immobilization abnormalities but had a significant affect on healing of established lesions.
