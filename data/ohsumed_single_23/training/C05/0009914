Joint inflammation provoked by a local synovial allergic reaction.
 Homocytotropic antibody was stimulated in animals by administering protein antigens in a vaccine with B.
 pertussis adjuvant.
 The titers of the allergic antibody responses were judged by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reactions.
 Sera or globulin fractions containing high titers of antibody activity were injected into the knee joints of experimental animals.
 After sufficient delay for unfixed proteins to be cleared from the knee joints, animals were challenged intravenously with the corresponding antigen.
 The resultant local reaction of swelling and warmth (passive synovial anaphylaxis) was judged visually and by scanning procedures.
 Histological studies showed evidence of mast cell degranulation concurrent with synovial reaction.
