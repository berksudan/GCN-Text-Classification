Pediatric spondyloarthropathies.
 Seronegative spondyloarthropathies in childhood are often misdiagnosed as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, but recognition of their distinct clinical manifestations and unique underlying pathophysiologies can aid in making a proper diagnosis.
 Ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, and the arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease are arthritides most often found in young adults, but they may also be present in children.
 Extraarticular manifestations include inflammation of the eyes, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract associated with inflammation of the entheses.
 The proper diagnosis will allow for treatment regimens that differ from those usually used for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
 Early diagnosis and treatment often lead to an early recovery and a return to normal daily activities.
