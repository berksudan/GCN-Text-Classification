Type XI collagen-degrading activity in human osteoarthritic cartilage.
 Homogenates of 6 samples of human osteoarthritic cartilage were shown to degrade exogenous type XI collagen.
 On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the cleavage products generated by each homogenate were similar, and they were identical to those obtained by cleavage of the substrate with purified gelatinase.
 Enzyme activity, which was inhibited by EDTA, was greater in extracts of fibrillated osteoarthritic cartilage than in extracts of grossly normal cartilage from the same joint or in extracts of cartilage from joints with osteonecrosis.
 Activation with APMA enhanced digestion, but breakdown was apparent in extracts of fibrillated osteoarthritic cartilage even without APMA.
 Enzymatic degradation of type XI collagen could play a significant role in the turnover of articular cartilage in health and disease states.
