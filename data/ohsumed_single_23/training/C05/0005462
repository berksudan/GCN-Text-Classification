Radical osteoclastic craniectomy in sagittal synostosis 
 We report our experience in the surgical treatment of sagittal synostosis using radical osteoclastic craniectomy in 60 consecutive patients.
 After surgery in children aged 6 months or younger (Group I), reossification usually started 2 weeks postoperatively and was complete within 6 months, resulting in an optimal skull contour.
 In children aged 7 to 12 months (Group II), reossification was prolonged and lasted for 12 months or longer.
 The skull contour normalized in its biparietal width and improved in sagittal diameter, remaining, however, slightly abnormal.
 In children older than 12 months (Group III), the skull contour partly improved in the biparietal diameter but did not change in the sagittal direction.
 Reossification was incomplete with persistent pseudosutures.
 Enlarged frontal subarachnoid spaces were reversible or improved in all patients independent of age at the time of surgery.
 We encountered no complications in our series.
 In our opinion, radical osteoclastic craniectomy is the simplest, most efficient, and most physiologically sound method for the treatment of sagittal synostosis in patients up to 6 months of age.
 This procedure allows the rapidly growing brain to form its skull vault, thus providing optimal cosmetic results.
 In older children, osteoplastic morcellation procedures should be the treatment of choice.
