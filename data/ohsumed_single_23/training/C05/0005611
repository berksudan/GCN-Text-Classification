Cross-sectional radiography for implant site assessment.
 An accurate tomographic technique is described for acquisition of optimal cross-sectional images of implant sites before implant surgery.
 The described technique is applicable to tomographic systems equipped with a cephalometric head positioner.
 This cross-sectional tomographic technique was performed on a series of patients and the images of the first 20 patients subsequently evaluated.
 The cross-sectional images allowed for the characterization of the alveolar crest and visualization of anatomic structures in a buccolingual dimension while providing an accurate estimation of available vertical space from the crest.
