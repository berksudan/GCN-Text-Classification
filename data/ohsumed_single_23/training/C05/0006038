The operative treatment of progressive early onset scoliosis. A preliminary report.
 Thirteen patients with progressive early onset scoliosis have been managed operatively in an attempt to achieve correction without bracing and to allow the spine to grow.
 All had posterior segmental spinal instrumentation (SSI) without fusion and 9 of 13 had anterior apical growth arrest as a separate additional procedure.
 At 2-year follow-up, curve correction averaged 46%.
 Patients who had anterior apical growth arrest and SSI without fusion had less curve deterioration than those who had SSI alone.
 New methods are described for 1) measuring growth of the instrumented segment of the spine and 2) calculating the predicted growth of the instrumented segment.
 Eight of the 13 had more than 50% of predicted growth, three had 30-50% of predicted growth, and two had less than 30% of predicted growth.
 Operative treatment has been successful in the short term in all but the most malignant form of infantile idiopathic scoliosis.
