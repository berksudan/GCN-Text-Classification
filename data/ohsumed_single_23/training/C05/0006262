Mother-daughter pairs: spinal and femoral bone densities and dietary intakes.
 Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine (L1-L4) and femur (femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and trochanter) was measured in 37 healthy, white mother-daughter pairs by dual-photon absorptiometry.
 Mothers and daughters were aged 52 +/- 7 and 25 +/- 4 y (mean +/- SD), respectively.
 Three-day dietary intakes were evaluated.
 Significant correlations between mother-daughter pairs for BMD of all lumbar and femoral areas [except for L2 (r = 0.26, P = 0.054)] indicated familial resemblances in bone mineralization.
 Total calcium intake was significantly correlated with three BMD values for the daughters (L2, femoral neck, and trochanter) but not for the mothers.
 When mothers were classified as pre- (n = 20) or postmenopausal (n = 17), correlation coefficients for BMD were higher for premenopausal mothers and their daughters and lower for postmenopausal mothers and their daughters, except for the trochanter.
 The results suggest that the nature of inheritance of bone mass of women may have at least two components, one influencing the level of peak bone mass and one related to bone loss at menopause.
