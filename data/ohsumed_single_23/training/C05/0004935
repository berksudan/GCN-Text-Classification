Evaluation of anterior maxillary alveolar ridge resorption when opposed by the transmandibular implant.
 Fifteen edentulous patients with complaints regarding denture comfort and/or function were treated with the transmandibular implant.
 All patients were restored with conventional maxillary dentures opposed by implant-supported removable prostheses.
 Two to 4 years after surgery, these patients were evaluated for vertical and horizontal maxillary bone loss with a radiographic analysis developed by the authors.
 With this technique, attention was focused on vertical alveolar ridge resorption in the anterior maxilla.
 Although the sample size was small, the findings from this study indicate that vertical bone loss in the anterior maxilla does occur when a maxillary denture is opposed by an implant-supported overdenture.
 Comparison of these results with a previous study that evaluated anterior maxillary resorption when a complete maxillary denture opposed natural mandibular anterior teeth and a distal extension removable partial denture demonstrated no statistically significant difference.
