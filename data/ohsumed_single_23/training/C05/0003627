A sequential three-step lateral release for correcting fixed valgus knee deformities during total knee arthroplasty.
 An approach to mild, moderate, and severe fixed valgus deformities of the knee is described.
 The sequential approach to soft-tissue releases in the fixed valgus knee allows the surgeon to regain a neutral alignment in valgus deformities of up to 90 degrees.
 An additional benefit of the approach is spontaneous correction of fixed external tibial rotation deformities.
 Using this approach, early and late stability allows the use of unconstrained knee implants, including those with mobile-bearing elements.
