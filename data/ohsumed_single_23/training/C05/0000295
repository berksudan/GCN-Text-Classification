Intertrochanteric corrective osteotomy in slipped capital femoral epiphysis. A long-term follow-up study of 26 patients.
 The results of intertrochanteric corrective osteotomy in a series of 26 hips with moderate to severe chronic slipped capital femoral epiphysis are reported from follow-up studies in 1976 and 1986.
 In hips with a slippage of less than 40 degrees (ten hips), arthrosis was present in one hip.
 In the remaining 16 cases in which slippage exceeded 40 degrees, osteoarthrosis was present in 15, even though correction was adequate.
 From these observations it can be concluded that intertrochanteric corrective osteotomy does not prevent degeneration in cases with the most severe slip.
 On the basis of the present observations on treated and untreated cases, the authors advocate treatment by fixation without realignment, accepting the deformity in moderate and severe chronic slips.
 Rotational osteotomy may be considered in the event of hip joint contracture.
