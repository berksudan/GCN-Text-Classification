Effects of rib elongation on the spine. II. Correction of scoliosis in the rabbit.
 Three intercostal nerves on the right side of growing rabbits were resected partially.
 From 1 to 3 months later, moderate left-convex thoracic scoliosis with rotation of vertebrae had developed, and the sagittal curvatures of the spine had diminished.
 In one group of these animals, a mechanically produced increase of 1 cm in the length of one rib on the side of the convexity resulted in an immediate correction of the scoliotic deformity, an improvement that was still evident 3 weeks after the operation.
 In two other groups of rabbits, a further resection of three intercostal nerves, this time on the left convex side, 1 and 2 months after the first operation, resulted in regression of scoliosis or halted its progression.
 These results further support a new concept in which the precipitating factor in the development of scoliosis is ascribed to asymmetric longitudinal growth of the ribs.
 They also suggest that regulation of the rib length could be a promising approach to the effective correction of progressive scoliosis at an early stage in man.
