Improved primary surgical and dental treatment of clefts.
 The improved combination of surgical and dental teamwork in the primary treatment of clefts presented here is consistent with principles.
 In fact, this is a staged design for correction of classic clefts of the lip and palate that, based on biological principles, facilitates the continuance of the failed embryonic "migrations" toward a normal end point.
 Positioning of the alveolar segments, dissection of mucoperiosteum out of the cleft, and union of mucoperiosteum across the alveolar and anterior hard palate cleft make it possible to create a periosteal tunnel across the bony gap and set up a condition conducive to bone formation and eventual tooth eruption in the cleft area.
 Lip closure by adhesion reduces the tension of the primary lip closure and allows gentle molding until solidification of the arch occurs.
 Thus a complete cleft has been rendered an incomplete cleft.
 With a balanced, stabilized maxillary platform, the definitive lip and nose corrections can be carried to completion early (by 2 to 4 years of age).
 These planned actions bypass a persistent cleft, fistulas, raw areas, malposition of alveolar segments, and probably the necessity for later bone grafting.
 The only question not totally answered is the effect of this approach on final growth.
 Although most reports seem to indicate that growth has and will proceed within normal limits, another 10 years of careful follow-up is indicated and, in fact, is in progress.
