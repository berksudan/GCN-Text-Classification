Secondary correction of the unilateral cleft lip nose using a conchal composite graft.
 The secondary deformity of the unilateral cleft lip nose has many components.
 One is the dorsal dislocation of the lateral crus of the alar cartilage.
 We used a conchal composite graft positioned between the piriform aperture and the lateral crus and the upper lateral cartilage to correct this dislocation in nine patients.
 We believe that this graft is effective because it elevates the lateral crus of the alar cartilage off the depressed piriform aperture.
 This technique is very simple to perform, and it is easy to achieve nasal symmetry.
 Our results have been quite satisfactory, with no recurrence of dorsal dislocation.
 The donor site was covered by a subcutaneous pedicled flap from the cephaloauricular sulcus, leaving an inconspicuous deformity.
