Maintaining periodontal treatment.
 Dental maintenance, or supportive periodontal treatment (SPT), can keep the periodontium and peri-implant tissues healthy after active therapy.
 Patients who comply to suggested SPT fare better periodontally and keep their teeth longer.
 Data should be gathered by examinations, talking with patients, and reviewing personal oral hygiene.
 Then sub- and supra-gingival deposits should be removed.
 The average SPT visit should last 1 hour and should be scheduled every 3 months.
 Supportive periodontal treatment for patients with more advanced periodontal or peri-implant destruction should be the responsibility of the periodontist.
