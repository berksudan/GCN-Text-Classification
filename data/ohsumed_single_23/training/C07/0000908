An esthetic approach to vertical root extrusion in a patient with an anterior open bite: report of case.
 A previous attempt to locate the root canal system in the maxillary left central incisor with a bur created a perforating root defect at the level of the alveolar crest.
 The patient received root canal therapy.
 Next, vertical root extrusion was chosen to expose sound tooth structure apical to the defect so that a crown could be constructed.
 With an anterior open bite, the natural crown was left intact and it was possible to position the anchor bar in an incisal and lingual position, maintaining esthetics for the patient during both the extrusive and stabilization phases of treatment.
