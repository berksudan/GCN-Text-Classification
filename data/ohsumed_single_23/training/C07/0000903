Using periodontal plastic surgery techniques.
 In the 1980s, mucogingival surgery evolved into periodontal plastic surgery with various techniques designed to produce root coverage in areas of marginal tissue recession, to augment deficient ridges, and to lengthen crowns in cases of excessive gingival display.
 Periodontal plastic surgery not only enables the dentist to reconstruct but also to regenerate lost tissues.
