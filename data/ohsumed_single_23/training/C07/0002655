Long-term fate of the vascularized iliac crest bone graft for mandibular reconstruction.
 Vascularized bone grafts, such as the iliac crest, have become a major tool for mandibular reconstruction.
 Due to the growing trend toward immediate bone replacement followed by implant osseointegration and dental rehabilitation, further understanding of the long-term characteristics of these grafts is essential.
 Early postoperative bone scans demonstrate increased activity within the vascularized graft relative to surrounding bone.
 This study addressed the use of bone SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) scintigraphy as a long-term method of evaluating the integrity of vascularized bone grafts.
