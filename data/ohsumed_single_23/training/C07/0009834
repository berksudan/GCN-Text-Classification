Sialolithiasis: case studies and review.
 Three cases of sialolithiasis are presented, each representative of acute and chronic presentations of this problem.
 The evaluation and treatment of salivary gland and duct stones are outlined.
 The primary axiom is, "Treat the gland, not the stone," and the essential aspects of emergency medical management are antibiotics, sialogogues, warm compresses, mechanical stimulation, and appropriate referral to an otolaryngologist.
