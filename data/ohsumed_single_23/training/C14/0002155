Lower extremity percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: multifactorial analysis of morbidity and mortality.
 We analyzed the outcome of 202 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) procedures performed between 1983 and 1989 to quantitate procedural risks and define factors associated with suboptimal results or immediate clinical failure.
 Premorbid factors studied included age, sex, treatment of single versus multiple lesions, stenoses versus occlusions, premorbid status of the limb (claudication vs limb threat), and most distal level of PTA.
 Adverse outcomes included complications (hematoma, acute occlusion, or thrombosis of PTA site, distal embolization, failure to dilate or cross, arterial dissection, rupture, and significant systemic derangement), major amputations (below knee and above knee), and deaths.
 There were 66 complications (32.7%), 22 amputations (10.9%), and 12 deaths (5.9%) in our series.
 Logistic regression analysis revealed that the major predictive variable for the occurrence of a complication (p = 0.002), and the only predictive variable for the outcomes of amputation and death (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0139, respectively), was the premorbid clinical status of the limb.
 Lower extremity PTA is not an intrinsically benign procedure and is associated with a significant risk of complication, amputation, and procedure-associated death.
 These adverse outcomes cluster in patients with limb threat.
 Therefore it may be reasonable to restrict the use of PTA to patients with claudication and strictly selected cases of limb threat.
