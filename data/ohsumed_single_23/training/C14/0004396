Determinants of the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation.
 Determinants of the ventricular cycle length during atrial fibrillation were examined in 52 patients.
 Thirty-three patients had structural heart disease and none had an accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection.
 The AV node effective and functional refractory periods, the shortest atrial pacing cycle length associated with 1:1 conduction, the AV node conduction time and indexes of concealed conduction in the AV node were measured in the baseline state (36 patients) and after modification of sympathetic tone by infusion of isoproterenol or propranolol (8 patients each).
 Atrial fibrillation was then induced with rapid atrial pacing, and the mean, shortest and longest ventricular cycle lengths were measured.
 Variables that correlated most strongly with the mean RR interval during atrial fibrillation were the AV node effective refractory period (r = 0.93; p less than 0.001), AV node functional refractory period (r = 0.87; p less than 0.001) and shortest atrial pacing cycle length associated with 1:1 conduction (r = 0.91; p less than 0.001).
 The AH interval during sinus rhythm (r = 0.74; p less than 0.001) and during atrial pacing at the shortest cycle length with 1:1 conduction (r = 0.52; p less than 0.001) had weaker correlations.
 Measures of concealed conduction did not improve the prediction of the mean or longest ventricular cycle length during atrial fibrillation.
 In conclusion, the refractory periods and conductivity of the AV node are the best indicators of the potential of the node to transmit atrial impulses to the ventricles during atrial fibrillation.
 The degree of concealed conduction in the AV node is a less important determinant of the mean ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation.
