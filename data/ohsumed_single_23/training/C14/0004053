Characteristics of biliary lipid metabolism after liver transplantation.
 Biliary lipid metabolism was studied after 10 liver transplantations with continuous drainage of bile.
 Within 3 wk after transplantation, the new liver produced bile with concentrations of biliary lipids in agreement with those reported for T-tube bile in cholecystectolized nontransplanted subjects.
 Although changes in biliary lipid composition occurred swiftly in response to various forms of disturbed liver function, they did not provide substantially more information than did standard serum tests or simple measurements of bile flow in most patients.
 Secretion rates of phospholipids and cholesterol were found to be completely bile acid dependent.
 For each micromole of bile acids, 0.22 and 0.08 mumol of phospholipids and cholesterol were secreted, respectively.
 When bile flow was related to bile acid output, a linear relationship was found (r = 0.89), with a positive intercept indicating a bile acid-independent bile flow of approximately 44 microliters/min.
 Analysis of individual bile acids showed almost exclusively primary bile acids.
 The relative proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid was more prominent during the first days after transplantation.
 Different explanations for this are discussed.
