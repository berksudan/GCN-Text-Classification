Balloon rupture due to lesion morphology during coronary angioplasty.
 We report a case of coronary angioplasty of a left anterior descending artery lesion that was complicated by the rupture of three successive balloon catheters.
 Each rupture occurred as a pinhole jet of contrast into a diagonal side branch, causing subintimal staining.
 This case demonstrates that balloon rupture may result from lesion morphology.
