Experimental and clinical percutaneous angioscopy experience with dynamic angioplasty.
 The authors have used ultrathin angioscopes with high optical resolution to assess the effects of dynamic angioplasty in vitro and in vivo.
 Experimentally, angioscopy was used to study the effects of the 5F "Kensey" catheter in "normal" porcine coronary arteries (NPCA) and postmortem human coronary arteries (PMHCA).
 In NPCA, the catheter keeps a coaxial position.
 Intimal flaps (IFs) were seen in 21/23 NPCAs.
 They occurred with all cam rotation speeds and were usually single and small (less than 25% of lumen).
 Perforations in patent arteries were rare (1/23).
 However, when the catheter was forced against the wall by passing through a narrowing of 5F diameter (made by a band ligature), perforations were more common at higher cam speeds.
 The epicardium remained intact in two thirds of perforations.
 Angioscopy visualized perforations in only 10% of cases (1/10), the common sign being that of large and multiple intimal flaps, which were often obstructive (5/10).
 In PMHCAs, angioscopy was more sensitive than angiography in detecting atheromatous lesions.
 The authors were able to give a better assessment of the effect of dynamic angioplasty on treated lesions, including the demonstration of intimal flaps that were not visible on angiography.
 In vivo, they have performed percutaneous angioscopy before and after dynamic angioplasty using 8 French Kensey catheters.
 Angioscopy revealed features that were not shown angiographically.
