Frequency of myocardial indium-111 antimyosin uptake after uncomplicated coronary artery bypass grafting.
 The reported incidence of myocardial damage after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is highly related to the methods used.
 Since indium-111 monoclonal antimyosin antibody scintigraphy has been shown to be highly specific and sensitive for myocardial necrosis, even in small lesions, uptake of this radiotracer was evaluated after CABG.
 In 23 consecutive patients without previous myocardial infarction who underwent CABG for stable angina, 80 MBq indium-111 antimyosin was injected on the third postoperative day.
 Planar images were obtained 48 hours later and analyzed for myocardial uptake of indium-111 antimyosin.
 Scintigraphic results were related to creatine kinase MB levels, duration of both aortic cross-clamping and cardiopulmonary bypass, and electrocardiographic changes.
 In all patients surgical procedure and postoperative course was uncomplicated.
 Indium-111 antimyosin uptake was present in 19 of 23 patients (82%).
 It was diffused in 7 patients and localized in 12.
 No pathologic Q waves occurred postoperatively.
 Fourteen patients exhibited ST-segment changes.
 No good relation was found among indium-111 antimyosin uptake and creatine kinase MB levels, duration of cross-clamping or bypass, and ST-T changes.
 It is concluded that some degree of myocardial damage, though silent, is common after CABG.
