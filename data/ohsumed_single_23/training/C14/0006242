Effectiveness of the once-daily calcium antagonist, lacidipine, in controlling 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure.
 The efficacy of the new once-daily dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, lacidipine, in reducing ambulatory intraarterial blood pressure (BP) was examined in 12 untreated hypertensive patients.
 The intraarterial recording was commenced 24 hours before the first 4-mg dose and was continued for a further 24 hours thereafter.
 After dose titration and chronic therapy, a second 24-hour ambulatory BP recording was made.
 There was a steady onset of drug action, maximal at 2 hours, but with reflex tachycardia after the first dose.
 Chronic administration reduced BP throughout the 24-hour period, without tachycardia.
 Mean daytime reduction in BP was 20 mm Hg systolic (p less than 0.005) and 12 mm Hg diastolic (p less than 0.02).
 Mean nighttime reduction was 8-mm Hg systolic (p less than 0.05) and 6-mm Hg diastolic (difference not significant).
 There was no postural decrease in BP on 60 degrees head-up tilting and hypotensive action was maintained during isometric exercise (reduction at peak of 32/18 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and throughout dynamic exercise (reduction at peak of 23/14 mm Hg, p less than 0.05).
 Lacidipine is an effective once-daily antihypertensive agent, with good control of stress response.
