Single lung transplantation for primary pulmonary hypertension.
 Single lung transplantation has become a therapeutic option for end-stage interstitial lung disease and obstructive lung disease.
 Our group recently extended this treatment to three patients with primary pulmonary hypertension.
 All patients had marked decreases in pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance and increases in cardiac output following single lung transplantation.
 Spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity were not different in comparison to preoperative studies.
 Quantitative ventilation-perfusion scans revealed the majority of perfusion distributed to the transplanted lung, with ventilation approximately equally divided between the native and the transplanted lung.
 Despite ventilation-perfusion imbalance, there was no resting hypoxemia and there was no arterial oxygen desaturation with exercise.
 One patient expired on the 30th postoperative day due to cytomegalovirus infection of the lungs.
 In the remaining two patients, maximum exercise capacity following transplantation was near normal in one recipient and reduced in the second recipient.
 Of note, there was no evidence of ventilatory limitation or impaired oxygenation during exercise in these two recipients.
 Although an exaggerated exercise ventilatory response was present, this did not limit exercise performance.
 This report supports the use of single lung transplantation for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension.
