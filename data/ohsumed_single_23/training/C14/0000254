A rapid, effective technique for retrograde crossing of valvular aortic stenosis using standard coronary catheters 
 Retrograde crossing of valvular aortic stenosis can be challenging even to experienced angiographers.
 In 446 of 447 consecutive patients with aortic stenosis catheterized during the past 3 years, a technique using a standard Judkins right coronary catheter and a floppy straight tipped guide wire was successful in rapidly and efficiently crossing these pathologically distorted valves in retrograde fashion.
 Once the valve was crossed, the coronary catheter was replaced with a pigtail catheter for pressure and ventriculography.
 The majority of these valves required less than 2 min to cross using this technique.
 This method is valuable in limiting the time required for catheterization, thus helping to reduce procedure related morbidity in these oftimes critically ill patients.
