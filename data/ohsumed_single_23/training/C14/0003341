Pulse oximetry: a new non-invasive assessment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease.
 Peripheral skin perfusion reflects the level of vascularity and viability of a limb and may help in planning the site of amputation or bypass surgery in patients with vascular disease.
 This study used peripheral pulse oximetry in 20 healthy volunteers and in 20 patients with limb ischaemia.
 Pulse oximetry saturation levels (Psa,O2) were compared with ankle artery Doppler pressures and transcutaneous oxygen measurements (Ptc,O2).
 Recordings were taken at two standard sites distally and referenced to finger and forearm to calculate an index.
 A significant correlation was found between Ptc,O2 and Psa,O2 in patients with ischaemia (r = 0.68, P less than 0.01).
 A further group of 12 patients with acute limb ischaemia was similarly assessed before and after revascularization.
 After revascularization mean(s.d.) Ptc,O2 increased from 38(13) to 44(1) mmHg (P greater than 0.05) and mean(s.d.) Psa,O2 increased from 86(3) to 90(4) per cent (P less than 0.01).
 These data suggest that pulse oximetry is a more sensitive index of peripheral perfusion than Ptc,O2 or ankle artery Doppler pressure and that, because of its accuracy and simplicity, it merits further use.
