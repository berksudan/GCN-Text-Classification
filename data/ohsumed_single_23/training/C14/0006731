Dissecting aneurysm of the pulmonary artery with pulmonary hypertension.
 Pulmonary artery dissection was observed in a 64-yr-old female patient with severe pulmonary hypertension, which was probably primary (pulmonary vascular resistance, 817 dyn.s.cm-5; normal range less than or equal to 200 dyn.s.cm-5).
 The patient was admitted to the hospital because of severe dyspnea on exertion.
 Echocardiography demonstrated a dissecting aneurysm of the pulmonary artery.
 Right heart catheterization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure, 64 mm Hg; normal range, 10 to 22 mm Hg); dissection of the pulmonary artery was confirmed by pulmonary arteriography.
 One-year follow-up was uneventful.
 In the literature, 28 patients with dissecting aneurysm of the pulmonary artery are reviewed.
 The dissection has only been diagnosed in life in one patient (by echocardiography).
