Relation between intraventricular pressure and volume in diastole.
 The pressure-volume curves for 10 patients with various types of heart disease were studied throughout mid to late diastole when both pressure and volume were increasing.
 The results were used to test a currently held theory that the form of this relation is exponential.
 It was found that for the patients examined this hypothesis was not valid.
