Diagnostic value of a new myocardial perfusion agent, teboroxime (SO 30,217), utilizing a rapid planar imaging protocol: preliminary results [corrected and republished with original paging, article originally printed in J Am Coll Cardiol 1990 Oct;16(4):855-61]
 Technetium-99m-labeled agents have advantages over thallium-201 in terms of photon statistics, cost and clinical availability.
 They have been suggested as an alternative to thallium for myocardial perfusion imaging.
 Teboroxime is a new boronic acid adduct of technetium dioxime (BATO) compound that demonstrates favorable characteristics in preliminary studies.
 With use of a novel (seated) patient positioning technique and a rapid dynamic acquisition protocol, 30 patients underwent planar imaging with teboroxoime while at rest and after maximal treadmill exercise.
 Postexercise scans were completed in an average time (mean +/- SD) of 4.4 +/- 1.6 min, with 4.8 +/- 1.5 min for the views at rest.
 These results were compared with coronary arteriography or thallium scintigraphy after treadmill exercise, or both.
 Diagnostic agreement (abnormal versus normal) was present in 28 of the 30 patients (p less than 0.001).
 Regarding physiologic assessment as compared with thallium scintigraphy, the finding of infarction and ischemia was concordant in 89% and 86% of patients, respectively.
 This report describes the initial use of teboroxime with a rapid dynamic planar imaging technique, resulting in a high correlation with exercise thallium scintigraphy.
 Delayed postexercise images obtained 5 to 10 min after exercise demonstrated rapid disappearance of exercise-induced defects noted on the initial (0 to 5 min) postexercise views.
 The rapid differential washout with teboroxime has not been previously described and the possible clinical significance is discussed.
