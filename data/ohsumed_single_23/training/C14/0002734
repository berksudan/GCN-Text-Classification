Coronary artery dissection--a case report.
 Coronary artery dissection, both spontaneous and catheter-induced, is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality.
 The authors present a case of a middle-aged woman with spontaneous right coronary artery dissection causing inferior wall myocardial infarction and left coronary artery dissection at the time of coronary arteriography.
 It is suggested that emergency aortocoronary bypass surgery be performed preceded by insertion of an intra-aortic balloon in acute evolving cases where coronary anatomy is favorable to limit infarction and avert loss of life.
