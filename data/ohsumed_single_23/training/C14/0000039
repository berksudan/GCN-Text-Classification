Flow patterns in dilated cardiomyopathy: a pulsed-wave and color flow Doppler study.
 In 48 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, pulsed-wave and color Doppler examination were performed.
 In addition, 14 normal patients served as control subjects.
 Peak inflow velocity at the level of the mitral valve, middle left ventricle, and apex and outflow velocity at the level of the apex, middle left ventricle, and subaortic area were measured.
 In normal patients there was brisk propagation of inflow velocity to the apex.
 Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy demonstrated delayed propagation and prolongation of the duration of inflow compared with control subjects (p less than 0.04).
 Continuous apical flow was visualized in 25% of dilated cardiomyopathies and in no normal patients.
 Apical velocities were significantly increased in cardiomyopathies with significant mitral regurgitation.
 Outflow velocities were decreased in dilated cardiomyopathy.
 In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and apical dyskinesis, flow directed toward the base was measured in the middle left ventricle during isovolumic relaxation secondary to dyskinetic rebound.
 Patterns of abnormal flow in dilated cardiomyopathies are readily apparent by color M-mode and two-dimensional color Doppler.
