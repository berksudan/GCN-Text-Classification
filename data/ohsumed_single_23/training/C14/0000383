Traumatic rupture of aorta. Diagnosis by Doppler echocardiography.
 Traumatic rupture of aorta is a serious complication in accidents, mainly road accidents, with a high mortality unless an immediate diagnosis and surgical correction is made.
 A case of traumatic rupture of the aorta shown in the acute phase by Doppler-echocardiography is reported.
 This technique can be of great value in the study of patients with thoracic trauma who do not show clear signs of aortic rupture which require urgent aortography.
