Right ventricular function and metabolism.
 Right ventricular protection may be limited with current methods of cardioplegic delivery.
 Sensitive measurements of right and left ventricular function and metabolism were made in 30 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery with cold cardioplegic arrest.
 Myocardial adenine nucleotide concentrations decreased with cardioplegia and reperfusion in both the right and left ventricles despite adequate levels of precursors, suggesting perioperative mitochondrial dysfunction.
 Postoperatively, right and left ventricular pressures were measured with micromanometer catheters and volumes were measured by nuclear ventriculography.
 Right and left ventricular systolic elastance was calculated by the isochronic method and by the end-systolic method.
 Both methods provided sensitive indexes of end-systolic elastance.
 This study demonstrated that right ventricular function and metabolism can be evaluated by methods analogous to methods used in the left ventricle.
 These results suggest that right ventricular functional and metabolic recovery are delayed despite apparently adequate myocardial protection.
 Sensitive measurements may permit improved assessment of alternative methods of right ventricular protection.
