Use of a guiding catheter for contralateral femoral artery angioplasty.
 We describe a unique method employing a transseptal sheath as a "guiding catheter" that allows contralateral retrograde femoral artery access to perform balloon angioplasty of proximal superficial femoral artery lesions.
 This technique simplifies arterial access, provides support for crossing lesions, and allows angiographic visualization of target lesions during the procedure.
