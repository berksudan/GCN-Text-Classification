Clinical use of the Berlin Biventricular Assist Device as a bridge to transplantation.
 The Berlin Artificial Heart System/Biventricular Assist Device (BVAD) was used in 38 patients.
 1) Twenty-eight patients were awaiting cardiac transplantation (Tx) (age 23-56 yrs).
 All patients had contraindications not allowing immediate Tx.
 2) Five patients were emergency cases not on our Tx list (postcardiotomy cardiac failure, acute myocarditis) (age 28-59).
 3) Five patients were post Tx patients with graft failure (age 22-52).
 Extracorporal circulation was used for implantation of the BVAD.
 In group 1, 21 of 28 patients (pts) recovered, and all were subsequently transplanted after 6 hours to 39 days, when all organ function was restored.
 In 7 pts, mechanical circulation was terminated after 1-40 days because of further deterioration.
 Five of the transplanted pts died, 14 pts survived (greater than 30 days), and 2 pts were just transplanted with satisfactory postoperative courses.
 Of group 2 and 3 pts, two were successfully weaned.
 In one patient the allograft recovered after 11 days of support.
