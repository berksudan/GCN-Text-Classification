Silent myocardial ischemia: dilemma or blessing?
 Developing an optimal strategy for the evaluation and management of patients with silent myocardial ischemia is extremely difficult.
 Although otherwise healthy, asymptomatic individuals may be at risk of dying suddenly during exercise, neither exercise testing nor Holter monitoring reliably identifies those at greatest risk.
 In patients with underlying coronary artery disease, silent ischemia increases the risk of an adverse outcome.
