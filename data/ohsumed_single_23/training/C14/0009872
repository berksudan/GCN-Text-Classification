Nisoldipine--effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and catecholamines. Studies in normotensive and hypertensive subjects.
 We have studied the effects of nisoldipine, a new calcium channel antagonist, on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and on plasma catecholamines in 10 healthy volunteers and in 29 patients with primary essential hypertension.
 Of these 29 patients, thirteen had normal renin hypertension (NRH), and sixteen had low renin hypertension (LRH).
 Eight healthy volunteers received placebo.
 Short-term (24 h) effects were measured in all subjects and long-term (up to 6 months) effects of 10-40 mg nisoldipine daily were monitored in the 29 hypertensive patients.
 Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased slightly, although this rise was not statistically significant, 1 h after the first dose of nisoldipine in both normotensive subjects and hypertensive patients.
 After 2 h PRA had returned to the pre-treatment level.
 No change in PRA was observed after administration of placebo.
 Plasma angiotensin II (AII) levels showed considerable variation after nisoldipine administration.
 Plasma aldosterone levels decreased despite the increase in PRA and AII concentrations.
 However, no concomitant reduction in urinary aldosterone excretion was observed.
 Plasma noradrenaline levels increased slightly 2-4 h after administration of nisoldipine, and decreased again thereafter, but no changes in plasma adrenaline levels were seen.
 Nisoldipine had no long-term effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or on serum catecholamine levels.
