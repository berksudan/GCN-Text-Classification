Optimizing heparin utilization in angiographic flush solutions.
 Various concentrations of heparin in angiographic flush solutions are employed during angiography.
 In an effort to determine whether differences in outcome are seen when either high or low concentrations of heparin in angiographic flush solutions are utilized, two groups of patients were evaluated.
 There was no difference in outcome and a small systemic effect from heparin was seen in both groups.
 Use of a low concentration of heparin is suggested for routine angiography.
