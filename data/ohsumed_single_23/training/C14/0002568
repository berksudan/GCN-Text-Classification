Oral contraceptives, lipoproteins, and atherosclerosis.
 A nonhuman primate model was developed to study the effects of oral contraceptives on lipoproteins and atherosclerosis.
 Cynomolgus macaques were selected because of their susceptibility to diet-induced atherosclerosis and because their reproductive physiology, menstrual cycle, and circulating sex hormone patterns are similar to those of human females.
 The first study compared a vaginal ring containing levonorgestrel and estradiol with an oral contraceptive containing norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol.
 A second study compared two oral combinations: norgestrel-ethinyl estradiol and ethynodiol diacetate-ethinyl estradiol.
 As predicted, use of all the contraceptives led to lowering of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
 However, contrary to what might be expected, use of the ethinyl estradiol-containing oral contraceptives did not lead to an increase in the prevalence or extent of atherosclerosis.
 We concluded that ethinyl estradiol neutralized the atherogenic influence of the progestin component of oral contraceptives.
