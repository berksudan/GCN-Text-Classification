"White coat" versus "sustained" borderline hypertension in Tecumseh, Michigan 
 During a survey of young subjects not receiving treatment for hypertension in Tecumseh, Michigan, clinic and self-monitored blood pressures taken at home (14 readings in 7 days) were obtained in 737 subjects (387 men, 350 women, average age 31.5 years).
 Hypertension in the clinic was diagnosed if the clinic blood pressure exceeded 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic.
 In the absence of firm criteria for what constitutes hypertension at home, subjects whose average home blood pressure was in the upper decile of the whole population were considered to have hypertension at home.
 By these criteria, 7.1% of the whole population had "white coat" hypertension (i.e., high clinic but not elevated home readings).
 The prevalence of "sustained" hypertension (i.e., high readings in the clinic and at home) was 5.1%.
 Subjects with white coat and sustained borderline hypertension in Tecumseh were very similar.
 Both groups showed, at previous examinations (at ages 5, 8, 21, and 23 years), significantly higher blood pressure readings than the normotensive subjects.
 As young adults (average age 33.3 years), the parents of both hypertensive groups had significantly higher blood pressure readings than the parents of normotensive subjects.
 Both hypertensive groups had faster heart rates, higher systemic vascular resistance, and higher minimal forearm vascular resistance.
 Both hypertensive groups were more overweight, had higher plasma triglycerides, insulin, and insulin/glucose ratios than normotensive subjects.
 The white coat hypertensive group also had lower values of high density lipoprotein than the normotensive group.
 White coat hypertension is a frequent condition.
