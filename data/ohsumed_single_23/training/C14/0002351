Timing and mechanism of in-hospital and late death after primary coronary angioplasty during acute myocardial infarction.
 The effect of early myocardial reperfusion on patterns of death after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unknown.
 Thus, the mechanism and timing of in-hospital and late deaths among a group of 614 patients treated with coronary angioplasty without antecedent thrombolytic therapy for AMI were determined.
 Death occurred in 49 patients (8%) before hospital discharge.
 Four patients died in the catheterization laboratory.
 Death was due to cardiogenic shock in 22 patients, acute vessel reclosure in 5 patients, was sudden in 8 patients and followed elective coronary artery bypass surgery in 8 patients.
 Cardiac rupture was observed in only 2 patients after failed infarct angioplasty, and did not occur among the 574 patients with successful infarct reperfusion.
 Intracranial hemorrhage did not occur.
 Multivariate predictors of in-hospital death included failed infarct angioplasty, cardiogenic shock, 3-vessel coronary artery disease and age greater than or equal to 70 years.
 During a follow-up period of 32 +/- 21 months (range 1 to 87), 55 patients died.
 The cause of death was cardiac in 36 patients, including an arrhythmic death in 23 patients and was due to circulatory failure in 13 others.
 One patient died of reinfarction due to late reclosure of the infarct artery.
 Actuarial survival curves demonstrated overall survival after hospital discharge of 95 and 87% at 1 and 4 years, respectively.
 Freedom from cardiac death at 1 and 4 years was 96 and 92%.
 Multivariate predictors of late death included 3-vessel disease, a baseline ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40%, age greater than 70 years and female gender.
