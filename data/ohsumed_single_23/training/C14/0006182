Detection and quantitation of ischemic left ventricular dysfunction using a new video intensity technique for regional wall motion evaluation.
 Eighty patients with ischemic heart disease and 17 normal subjects were evaluated for left ventricular regional wall motion by means of a new method.
 The wall motion analysis is based on video intensity.
 This technique uses a temporally sliding analysis to evaluate the cardiac cycle in 100 msec intervals.
 Presence of coronary artery disease was defined as more than 50% measured diameter stenosis.
 Wall motion abnormalities in regions perfused by stenotic vessels were most common in early diastole (76%).
 Sensitivity of this method at rest in patients with coronary artery disease was 79.7% (p less than 0.0001) and overall accuracy was 84.2% (p less than 0.0001).
 Abnormalities in both systole and diastole were more common in regions perfused by severe lesions (greater than 75%) than in those perfused by moderately stenotic (less than 75%) vessels (p less than 0.05).
 A comparison of the new method with phase and amplitude analysis was performed in 15 patients and with two-frame analysis in 40 patients.
 This new method yielded a higher sensitivity than either of the other two methods.
