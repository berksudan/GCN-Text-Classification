Orthostatic hypotension following right ventricular myocardial infarction corrected with mineralocorticoid therapy.
 Severe hypotension while standing became a problem in a patient after discharge from the hospital following right ventricular myocardial infarction.
 Hemodynamic studies showed that right ventricular systolic function did not maintain adequate left ventricular preload and that the patient did not compensate for cardiac dysfunction by increasing blood volume.
 Volume expansion by mineralocorticoid therapy corrected the orthostatic hypotension and ameliorated symptoms.
 Hypotension eventually resolved and therapy was stopped four months after the myocardial infarction.
