Florid pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.
 A young woman presented with rapidly progressive dyspnea and clinical findings strongly suggestive of primary pulmonary hypertension or possible pulmonary embolism (or both).
 She died of acute right-sided heart failure.
 A diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease was made at autopsy.
 Approximately 100 cases of this disease have been reported previously in the literature.
 We describe a patient with a particularly florid progression of this unusual disease.
 Death occurred within six weeks of the onset of symptoms.
