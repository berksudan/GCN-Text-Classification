Haemorheological changes in patients with retinal vein occlusion after isovolaemic haemodilution.
 In 83 patients with central retinal vein occlusion and branch vein occlusion we measured the haematocrit (HCT), plasma viscosity (PV), red cell aggregation (RCA), red cell filterability (RCF) and apparent whole blood viscosity (WBV).
 A control group (n = 41) was matched for sex, age, and cardiovascular risk factors.
 Measurements were performed before and after treatment with isovolaemic haemodilution (IHD).
 We found no significant differences between patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and control subjects in haematocrit, plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, and red cell filterability and no increased whole blood viscosity in the patient group.
 Patients with ischaemic retinal vein occlusion and non-ischaemic retinal vein occlusion did not show different haemorheological parameters either.
 After treatment with haemodilution, only the haematocrit and whole blood viscosity were significantly decreased, and there were no changes in plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation or red cell filterability.
