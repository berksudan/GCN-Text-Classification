Current results of elective aortic reconstruction for aneurysmal and occlusive disease.
 Decisions to resect small aortic aneurysms or employ non-operative treatment for aorto-iliac occlusive disease must depend on current rather than historical surgical results.
 To assess current morbidity and mortality, we reviewed 200 consecutive aortic resections in two groups of patients treated from 1981 to 1989: those undergoing elective aortofemoral bypass for occlusive disease (AFB, no.
 100) or resection of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA, no.
 100).
 Indications for AFB included claudication (54%), rest pain (32%), and gangrene (13%).
 AAA size ranged from 3 to 14 cm (mean 6.5 +/- 2.4 cm); 45% presented with abdominal or back pain.
 Patients undergoing AFB were younger (AFB 61.5 +/- 10 years vs AAA 68.7 +/- 8.9 years) with a higher incidence of some atherosclerotic risk factors, diabetes mellitus 30% vs 10%, tobacco use 77% vs 49%, hyperlipidemia 21% vs 7%; p less than 0.001).
 Coronary artery disease (CAD) was more prevalent in AAA patients (49% vs 34%; p less than 0.001).
 Postoperative mortality was not different in occlusive or aneurysmal disease (3% AFB vs 2% AAA), nor was the occurrence of serious complications such as myocardial infarction (2% vs 1%) or pulmonary embolism (2% vs 3%).
 Improvements in patient selection, perioperative care and surgical technique have lowered the mortality of elective aortic surgery.
 Given the current standard of care, an aggressive approach to AAA even in high risk patients is appropriate.
 The low morbidity of AFB for occlusive disease mandates a critical appraisal of less effective nonoperative therapies.
