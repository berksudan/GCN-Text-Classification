Irrigation device for neuroangiographic procedures.
 A simple irrigation device for use in diagnostic and interventional neuroangiographic procedures is described.
 The device is used to flush bubbles and blood clots from catheter hubs.
 The authors also describe a technique in which this device can be used to prevent filling a catheter with air when a guide wire is removed.
