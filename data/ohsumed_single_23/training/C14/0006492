Clustering of atherogenic behaviors in coffee drinkers.
 We studied the clustering of coffee consumption and selected atherogenic behaviors in older adults living in a southern California community.
 Men were somewhat more likely to drink caffeinated coffee while women were more likely to drink decaffeinated coffee.
 In men, but not women, caffeinated coffee drinking decreased with age and decaffeinated coffee drinking increased.
 Caffeinated coffee drinkers drank more alcohol, consumed more dietary saturated fats and cholesterol, were more likely to be current smokers and less likely to be current exercisers than were non-coffee drinkers.
 Smoking and exercise also showed a dose-response relationship to the amount of caffeinated coffee consumed.
 Risk factor levels among drinkers of decaffeinated coffee were more like those of caffeinated coffee than non-drinkers.
 These data illustrate the clustering of atherogenic behaviors with coffee drinking and highlight their potential importance in interpreting the growing body of literature about coffee and health.
