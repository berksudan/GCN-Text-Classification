Clinical experience with technetium-99m teboroxime, a neutral, lipophilic myocardial perfusion imaging agent.
 Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) teboroxime is a new technetium-based myocardial perfusion imaging agent (investigational code = SQ30217 [Cardiotec, Squibb Diagnostics]).
 A member of a class of neutral, lipophilic, technetium-containing complexes known as boronic acid adducts of technetium dioxime (BATO) complexes, this agent is chemically very different from the cationic tracer thallium-201 (Tl-201) and from the cationic technetium complex Tc-99m sestamibi (Cardiolite, Du Pont Imaging Agents).
 Tc-99m teboroxime has high myocardial extraction, rapid blood clearance, little lung uptake and rapid myocardial washout.
 A biexponential pattern of myocardial washout is demonstrated in animals and in man.
 Effective half-lives of the 2 washout components in man are 5.2 minutes and 3.8 hours and represent approximately 66 and 33% of the myocardial activity, respectively.
 The first half-life for the myocardium is approximately 11 minutes.
 As the agent washes out of the heart, hepatic uptake occurs, peaking at about 5 minutes after injection.
 The liver is the major organ of excretion and receives, along with the large bowel, the largest radiation dose.
 Rapid imaging protocols using standard cameras have achieved good myocardial counts from 3 planar views acquired over a 4- to 5-minute period or for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images acquired over a 10-minute period.
 An entire stress/rest procedure can be completed in 1 hour.
 Analysis of data from 155 patients from 4 centers using planar or SPECT imaging showed a sensitivity and specificity for blinded readings of 82 and 91%, respectively, when compared against overall clinical impression.
