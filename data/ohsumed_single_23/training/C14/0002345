Use of technetium-99m sestamibi to determine the size of the myocardial area perfused by a coronary artery.
 The value of the new radionuclide tracer, technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi, to demonstrate myocardial perfusion in areas supplied by specific coronary arteries was evaluated in patients injected with the agent during cardiac catheterization.
 Tc-99m sestamibi differs from thallium-201 in its physical characteristics (photon energy 140 keV), half-life (6 hours) and lack of significant redistribution, allowing its administration during an episode of chest pain or ischemia occurring outside the nuclear medicine laboratory with later imaging to visualize the distribution.
 In 13 patients Tc-99m sestamibi was administered intravenously during balloon-occlusion angioplasty.
 In 11 of 13 patients, defects of the single photon emission computed tomography images corresponded to the area made ischemic during angioplasty.
 In the remaining 2 patients, abundant collateral flow was present and no defects were seen.
 In a second study, 15 patients had Tc-99m sestamibi selectively injected into a coronary artery during angiography.
 Later imaging identified the area supplied by the artery injected.
 Tc-99m sestamibi imaging can detect perfusion defects associated with short episodes of ischemia, and the area supplied by the different coronary arteries.
