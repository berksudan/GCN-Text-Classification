Cardiac catheterisation with 5 French catheters.
 From the beginning of November 1987 to the end of January 1989, 526 coronary arteriograms and left ventricular angiograms were performed with 5 French coronary catheters.
 In 448 (85%) patients diagnostic pictures were obtained with three standard types of 5 French catheters (No 4 Judkins): that is, left coronary, right coronary, and pigtail catheters.
 In 60 patients (11.4%) various other 5 French catheters were required to complete the study.
 In nine patients (1.7%), a 7 or 8 French catheter was used.
 Major complications causing cardiac arrest or requiring urgent operation developed in five patients.
 Sixty two patients (11.77%) had minor complications that required sublingual nitrates or a single bolus of atropine, or developed a haematoma that did not need intervention or had a mild reaction to the contrast material.
 Complications of moderate severity developed in 17 patients (3.2%): severe chest pain, arrhythmia requiring a temporary pacemaker, contrast reaction associated with hypotension, haematoma requiring blood transfusion, or a transient ischaemic episode.
 There were no deaths.
 5 French catheters were used for routine coronary angiography and left ventriculography in 98.3% of patients.
 There were no major complications related to femoral artery puncture.
 The routine use of 5 French coronary catheters should increase the feasibility of safe coronary angiography in outpatients and should reduce the cost of this investigation.
