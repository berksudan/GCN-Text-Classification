Percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty.
 To determine the efficacy of percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty as an adjunct or alternative to conventional balloon angioplasty, 55 patients were studied in a multicenter trial.
 These patients underwent the procedure using a modification of conventional balloon angioplasty technique.
 A first-generation, 1.6-mm diameter catheter constructed of 12 individual silica fibers concentrically arranged around a guidewire lumen was used.
 Catheter tip energy density varied from 35 to 50 mJ/mm2.
 The mean number of pulses delivered at 20 Hz was 1,272 +/- 1,345.
 Acute success was defined as a greater than or equal to 20% increase in stenotic diameter and a lumen of greater than or equal to 1 mm in diameter after laser treatment.
 Acute success was achieved in 46 of 55 (84%) patients.
 Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed on 41 patients (75%).
 The percent diameter stenosis as determined by quantitative angiography decreased from a baseline of 83 +/- 14 to 49 +/- 11% after laser treatment and to 38 +/- 12% in patients undergoing adjunctive balloon angioplasty.
 The mean minimal stenotic diameter increased from a baseline of 0.5 +/- 0.4 to 1.6 +/- 0.5 mm after laser treatment and to 2.1 +/- 0.5 mm after balloon angioplasty.
 There were no deaths and no vascular perforations.
 One patient (1.8%) required emergency coronary bypass surgery.
 These data suggest that excimer laser energy delivered percutaneously by specially constructed catheters can safely ablate atheroma and reduce coronary stenoses.
