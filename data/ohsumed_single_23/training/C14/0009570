Increase of intraplatelet free calcium ion during extracorporeal circulation with a hollow fiber oxygenator: arterial filter and dynamics of platelet thrombosis on oxygenator and filter in a pig model.
 Intraplatelet free calcium (IPFC) ions provide a common pathway for platelet activation leading to thrombosis and embolization.
 IPFC levels were determined by chlorotetracycline fluorometry during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) with systemic heparin in eight Yorkshire pigs (weighing 30-40 kg; 3 control and 5 ECC); the ratio of slow phase organelle calcium sequestration to fast phase platelet-membrane binding is an index of free calcium.
 During 3 hr of ECC with a hollow fiber oxygenator (HFO) (Bentley CM-50) and AF (Bentley 1025), seven blood samples were collected 5 min before and during ECC.
 The platelet deposition (CPM/microCi) on HFO (PDHFO) was simultaneously measured with In-111-labeled autologous platelets (300-400 microCi) and a Geiger probe detector at -5, 0, 5, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 min.
 During ECC, IPFC and HFO thrombus increase significantly (p less than 0.05) at 45 min with respect to control IPFC values of 0.4 +/- 0.1, suggesting direct participation of calcium activated platelets in thrombosis on HFO.
 The decline of IPFC is due to extrusion and sequestration by dense granules, and decline in HFO thrombus is due to embolization.
 On the other hand, the embolus in the arterial filter was trapped in a linear fashion, with a consistent increase with time of ECC.
