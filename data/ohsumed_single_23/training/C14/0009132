Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a non-Oriental man.
 Japanese investigators first described apical HCM in 2.9% of patients who had diagnostic left ventricular catheterization for suspected ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy.
 This entity was initially thought to be limited to individuals of Asian origin and has been uncommonly described in patients of Western origin.
 Patients of Western origin differ in several ways from those in the original description of Yamaguchi et al, but they both share the same classic criterion of hypertrophy of the left ventricular apex.
 The major differences probably relate to the anatomic variation in the distribution of the left ventricular hypertrophy as described by Maron et al.
 It is not known whether racial, genetic, or environmental factors account for the variation of disease expression in Asian and Western patients.
 Our case illustrates that this diagnosis should be considered in patients who have chest pain (anginal or atypical) and markedly abnormal findings on electrocardiograms in the absence of hypertension or significant coronary artery disease.
