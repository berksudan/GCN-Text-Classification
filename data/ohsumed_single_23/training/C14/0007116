Current status of antitachycardia devices.
 With the limitations of currently available modalities for treating clinically important tachycardias, the role of implanted antitachycardia devices will continue to expand.
 The challenge of the future will not only involve continued technological advances but the socioeconomic impact of this efficacious but expensive mode of therapy in an era of increasing financial restraints.
 Further studies to definitively prove the efficacy of more widespread use of antitachycardia device therapy will be needed.
