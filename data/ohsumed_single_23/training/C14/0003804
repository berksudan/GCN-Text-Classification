Short-term effect of hepatic arterial versus portal venous reperfusion on energy levels of liver tissue.
 The hepatic artery and the portal vein blood vary in flow, oxygenation, and hormonal content.
 It was uncertain which blood supply has a greater effect on the recuperative process of the hepatocytes in the ischemic liver during the initial reperfusion.
 The ability of the liver cells to restore its energy phosphates is related to the viability of the liver.
 This study was designed to determine the differences of the high energy phosphate in the liver predicated upon whether reflow was first provided by either the hepatic artery or the portal vein followed by subsequent reperfusion from both vessels.
 The recovery of ATP upon 10 min of only hepatic arterial reperfusion after 15 min of total ischemia was much slower compared to the portal venous reperfusion only.
 It may be undesirable, therefore, to reperfuse the liver with hepatic arterial blood first immediately after warm liver ischemia.
