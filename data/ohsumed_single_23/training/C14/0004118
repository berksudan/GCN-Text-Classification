Effects of anxiety on family members of patients with cardiac disease learning cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
 The effects of anxiety on learning cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by family members of patients with cardiac disease was examined.
 Family members of hospitalized patients (n = 17), family members of nonhospitalized patients (n = 12), and a control group (n = 21) all took one of nine Heart Saver programs in which CPR was taught and performance evaluated.
 Subjects took the State Anxiety Inventory three times: immediately before the program, immediately after the performance test, and 2 months after completion of the program.
 Family members of hospitalized patients had significantly higher before-program anxiety scores than the other groups.
 This difference was not present immediately after the program or 2 months later.
 Family members of hospitalized patients showed a significant decline in anxiety over the three testing times.
 These outcomes support the benefit of teaching CPR to this group.
