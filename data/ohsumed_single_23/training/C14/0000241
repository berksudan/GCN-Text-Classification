Retrograde recanalization of an occluded posterior tibial artery by using a posterior tibial cutdown: two case reports.
 Recanalization of two occluded posterior tibial arteries was successfully achieved by utilizing a retrograde approach via a posterior tibial artery cutdown at the level of the ankle.
 Both cases were previously unsuccessfully attempted by using an antegrade approach.
 Thus, the choice of access vessel (arterial entry site) becomes a crucial determinant of angioplasty success.
