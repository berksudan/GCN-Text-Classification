Early postoperative balloon coronary angioplasty for failed coronary artery bypass grafting.
 In a small number of patients, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) fails to relieve anginal symptoms.
 The usefulness of coronary angioplasty for the treatment of early (less than or equal to 90 days) recurrent ischemia after CABG was examined.
 Forty-five patients were treated from 2 to 90 days after CABG, including 8 patients studied emergently for prolonged ischemic symptoms.
 One-, 2- and 3-vessel native disease was found in 4, 10 and 31 patients, respectively.
 At the time of postoperative angiography, the major anatomic mechanism of recurrent ischemia was complete vein graft occlusion in 12 patients (27%), internal mammary artery occlusion in 3 (7%), vein graft stenoses in 13 (29%), internal mammary artery stenoses in 10 (22%), unbypassed disease in 4 (8%) and disease distal to the graft insertion site in 3 (7%).
 Angioplasty was successful at 91 of 98 sites (93%), including 95% of 41 lesions in native arteries, 89% of 46 lesions in vein grafts and 100% of 11 internal mammary artery lesions attempted.
 Complete revascularization was achieved in 84% of patients.
 There were 2 in-hospital deaths and 2 myocardial infarctions.
 Two additional patients underwent repeat CABG before discharge after uncomplicated but unsuccessful angioplasty.
 At late follow-up of the 43 survivors (mean 44 months), there were 4 deaths, 2 of which were noncardiac.
 Repeat CABG was required in only 3 patients and repeat angioplasty was performed in 10.
 Angina was absent or minimal in 35 patients; 17 patients were employed full time.
 Thus, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can relieve myocardial ischemia after unsuccessful CABG in the majority of patients.
