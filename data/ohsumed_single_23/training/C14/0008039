Insulin resistance and blood pressure in young black men.
 Insulin resistance, independent of obesity or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, has been demonstrated to be associated with high blood pressure.
 To determine if insulin resistance could be an antecedent to hypertension in a high-risk population, we studied normotensive (112 +/- 12/70 +/- 10 mm Hg) and borderline hypertensive (135 +/- 8/85 +/- 5 mm Hg) lean young black men (22-26 years old) with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique.
 All subjects had clinically normal oral glucose tolerance.
 Body mass index and percent adipose mass were the same in both groups.
 Fasting plasma insulin concentration was significantly higher in the borderline hypertensive group (p less than 0.01).
 Insulin-directed exogenous glucose metabolism at the same degree of steady-state hyperinsulinemia was significantly lower in the borderline hypertensive group (5.98 +/- 2.22 versus 8.22 +/- 1.96 mg/kg/min; p less than 0.01).
 For the total population, a significant inverse correlation existed between the glucose infusion rate and systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.01).
 These data indicate that there is a relation between insulin-mediated glucose uptake and blood pressure.
 Furthermore, in this high-risk population insulin resistance may precede the onset of established essential hypertension.
