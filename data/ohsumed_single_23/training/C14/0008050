Vascular flow capacity of hindlimb skeletal muscles in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
 Total and regional skeletal muscle flows (radiolabeled microspheres) were determined in isolated maximally vasodilated hindquarters of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched (11-12 mo) normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) to assess the vascular flow capacity of the skeletal muscle vascular beds.
 Vascular flow capacity was estimated by measuring total hindquarters and regional muscle blood flows (under conditions of maximal vasodilation with papaverine or papaverine plus isoproterenol) over a wide range of perfusion pressures in WKY and SHR.
 Capillary exchange capacity was estimated by determining the capillary filtration coefficient.
 Isogravimetric capillary pressures and segmental vascular resistances were determined in each hindquarter.
 Isogravimetric flows and capillary pressures were not different between WKY and SHR.
 However, total and precapillary vascular resistances were significantly elevated in SHR, and postcapillary resistances were not different compared with WKY.
 Maximal capillary filtration coefficient values for the SHR group averaged 20% lower than WKY values, suggesting that hypertension was associated with a reduction in the microvascular surface area available for fluid exchange and, therefore, the capillary exchange capacity.
 Over the perfusion pressures studied, total hindquarters flows averaged 60% lower in SHR than in WKY.
 Flows to individual skeletal muscles averaged 76% lower in SHR than in WKY regardless of the muscle fiber type.
 Thus, modifications exist in the hindlimb skeletal muscle vasculature of SHR that reduces the capillary exchange capacity and limit the capacity of deliver flow at a given perfusion pressure gradient.
