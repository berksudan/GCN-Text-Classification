Primary varicose veins: topographic and hemodynamic correlations.
 This study was conducted to correlate the clinical presentations of uncomplicated primary varicose veins with the topographic and anatomic source of reflux (escape points).
 One-hundred sixty-three patients with primary varicose veins (144 females, 19 males; 96 unilateral, 67 bilateral) in 230 involved limbs were examined.
 The origin and extent of venous reflux was traced with Doppler ultrasound.
 Three distinct groups were recognized.
 Group I.
 Typical saphenous varicosities with junctional escapes occurred in 164 (71.3%).
 Sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) incompetence in 147, and sapheno-popliteal junction (SPJ) incompetence in 17 limbs.
 Group II.
 Atypical saphenous varicosities with non-junctional escapes occurred in 51 (22.17%) limbs.
 In 5 limbs, no escape was detected.
 Twenty-two limbs had escapes localized in the main perforators: mid-thigh perforator 17, upper calf 2, distal ankle in 3.
 Twenty-four limbs had their escapes in the auxiliary perforators: abdomino-pelvic 17, and circumflex iliac/external epigastric, 7 limbs.
 Group III.
 Non saphenous (lateral venous system) varicosities occurred in 15 (6.52%) limbs.
 Based on physical examination alone, 55 limbs would possibly have undergone unnecessary ankle to groin stripping and 83 limbs an unnecessary SFJ ligation.
 Doppler US is an essential diagnostic tool that can accurately map the origin and extent of the venous reflux.
 The obtained hemodynamic information will permit more selective, multimodal therapy and avoid the indiscriminate, often unnecessary stripping of the entire saphenous system in all cases of primary varicose veins.
