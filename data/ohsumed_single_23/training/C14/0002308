Long-term follow-up in patients with incessant ventricular tachycardia.
 Seventeen patients with coronary artery disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or no organic heart disease who presented with incessant ventricular tachycardia (VT) were studied and followed for a mean period of 51 +/- 35 months.
 In these patients the incessant VT included greater than or equal to 3 episodes of sustained VT at a rate of greater than or equal to 120 beats/min and frequent episodes of nonsustained VT over a 24-hour period.
 No patient had electrolyte disorder, prolonged QT interval, drug-induced arrhythmia or myocardial infarction less than 2 weeks old.
 Six patients died within 27 months of follow-up; 4 from sudden death and 2 from acute myocardial infarction.
 Three of the 11 surviving patients had remission of their VT within 1 week after the diagnosis of incessant VT.
 In 3 other patients in whom antiarrhythmic drugs were discontinued during follow-up because of adverse effects of the drugs or other medical reasons, 2 were found in remission.
 In the remaining 5 alive patients, deliberate attempts were made to discontinue the antiarrhythmic drugs; 4 of these patients were found in remission when the drugs were discontinued.
 Thus, 9 of these patients (53%) with incessant VT had remission over a mean follow-up of 55 +/- 34 months after discontinuation of the antiarrhythmic drugs.
 The probability of remission in patients surviving incessant VT warrants trials of discontinuation of antiarrhythmic drugs in these patients.
