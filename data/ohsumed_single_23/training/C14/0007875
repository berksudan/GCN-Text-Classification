Use of pulmonary artery catheters in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Analysis of experience in 5,841 patients in the SPRINT Registry. SPRINT Study Group 
 This study analyzes the use of PAC in a registry comprising 5,841 hospitalized patients with AMI.
 A total of 371 patients received PAC.
 In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with CHF who received PAC, while there was no difference in patients with cardiogenic shock or persistent hypotension.
 Mortality in patients receiving PAC was higher irrespective of the presence or absence of "pump failure." A separate analysis of discharge summaries of 364 patients with CHF showed that PAC was used more frequently in sicker patients and that when severity of CHF was assessed, no difference in mortality was found in patients with mild or moderate CHF.
 We conclude that while a higher in-hospital mortality is found in patients receiving PAC, this excess is likely related to difference in severity of CHF, which had not been assessed in every individual.
 It is unlikely that PAC increases mortality.
