Changes in myocardial ischemic threshold during daily activities.
 This study assesses the variations in myocardial ischemic threshold (heart rate at the onset of ischemia) during daily activities in patients with ischemic episodes on Holter monitoring.
 Eighty patients with known coronary artery disease, positive treadmill stress test results and greater than or equal to 2 ischemic episodes during a 24-hour period of Holter monitoring were studied.
 The lowest and the highest ischemic thresholds were determined for each patient.
 The mean lowest ischemic threshold was 85 beats/min, and the mean highest ischemic threshold was 109 beats/min.
 The highest ischemic threshold was identical to ischemic threshold values noted during exercise.
 Of the 895 ischemic episodes, 654 (74%) were preceded by a moderate (greater than 10%) increase in heart rate.
 The variability of ischemic threshold (difference in percentage between the highest and lowest ischemic thresholds) increased with the number of ischemic episodes (range 2 to 60%).
 However, in different patients with a similar number of ischemic episodes, different variability was observed.
 These differences in ischemic thresholds are probably indirect indicators of the vasomotor activity of the coronary arteries in different patients.
