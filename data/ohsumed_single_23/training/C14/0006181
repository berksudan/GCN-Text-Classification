Left ventricular asynchrony: an indicator of regional myocardial dysfunction.
 There is a marked heterogeneity of myocardial wall thickening within the left ventricle and among different individuals.
 It is therefore difficult to detect regional myocardial dysfunction from absolute values of systolic wall thickening.
 We tested whether the extent of left ventricular asynchrony during ischemia and reperfusion can be used to quantify the severity of regional myocardial dysfunction when nonischemic baseline function is not known.
 In six anesthetized, open-chest dogs regional myocardial wall thickness was measured by means of sonomicrometry under control conditions, at three degrees of ischemic dysfunction (mild, moderate, and severe), and after release of a 15-minute occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery, when degrees of moderate and mild reperfusion dysfunction similar to the preceding ischemic dysfunction were present.
 Two indexes of left ventricular asynchrony were calculated: (1) postejection thickening (PET) and (2) the phase difference of the first Fourier harmonic of posterior versus anterior myocardial wall motion (PD).
 Systolic myocardial wall thickening was decreased from 15.3 +/- 3.1 (standard deviation) % (control value) to 9.7 +/- 1.4% (mild ischemia), 4.2 +/- 1.6% (moderate ischemia), and -3.7 +/- 3.1% (severe ischemia).
 Conversely PET increased from 0.02 +/- 0.04 mm (control value) to 0.15 +/- 0.22 mm (mild ischemia), 0.19 +/- 0.15 mm (moderate ischemia), and 0.50 +/- 0.26 mm (severe ischemia).
 PD increased from 9 +/- 28 degrees (control value) to 22 +/- 19 degrees (mild ischemia), 54 +/- 18 degrees (moderate ischemia), and 107 +/- 21 degrees (severe ischemia).
 After release of the 15-minute left circumflex coronary artery occlusion, PET and PD recovered to 0.34 +/- 0.19 mm and 36 +/- 24 degrees (moderate dysfunction) and 0.25 +/- 0.31 mm and 29 +/- 8 degrees (mild dysfunction), respectively.
 There were inverse linear relationships between systolic wall thickening and PET (r = -0.86, p less than 0.001) and between systolic wall thickening and PD (r = -0.87, p less than 0.001).
 Inotropic stimulation by postextrasystolic potentiation increased regional systolic myocardial posterior and anterior wall thickening but did not alter the extent of left ventricular asynchrony.
 Thus, when normal baseline function is not known, the severity of regional myocardial dysfunction at a given inotropic state can be determined by analysis of left ventricular asynchrony.
 There was no significant correlation between the extent of PET and PD during ischemia and at early reperfusion and the recovery of contractile function at late reperfusion.
 Thus PET does not provide a prospective marker for the functional outcome of reperfusion.
