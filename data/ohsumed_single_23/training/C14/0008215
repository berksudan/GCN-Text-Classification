Production of thrombi on intact endothelium by use of antiheparin agents in vivo.
 It had been suggested that antithrombin activity on the surface of intact endothelial cells may play a role in inhibiting platelet adhesion and thrombus formation.
 The antithrombin activity may be due to thrombomodulin or to activation of antithrombin III by glycosaminoglycans or thrombomodulin, or possibly a combination of these.
 This inhibitory activity has been shown to be affected by such antiheparin agents as protamine, hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene; Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) and platelet factor 4, as well as by such enzymes as heparinase and heparitinase.
 We have used a hamster cheek pouch preparation to observe thrombus formation in vivo in a normal vascular flow, to determine whether the production of thrombi by thrombin can be enhanced by antiheparin agents.
 After intra-arterial injection or topical application of protamine or hexadimethrine bromide, platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on intact arteriolar endothelium was produced by a dose of thrombin, which when injected alone had no effect.
 No thrombi were found in venules or capillaries.
 Injection of heparin before or after the antiheparin agents necessitated a larger dose to enhance the action of thrombin.
 On electron microscopy the thrombi were found to consist primarily of platelets adherent to an intact endothelium.
 The possible clinical implications of these observations are discussed.
