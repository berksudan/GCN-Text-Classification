Further mapping of an ataxia-telangiectasia locus to the chromosome 11q23 region.
 We recently mapped the gene for ataxia-telangiectasia group A (ATA) to chromosome 11q22-23 by linkage analysis, using the genetic markers THY1 and pYNB3.12 (D11S144).
 The most likely order was cent-AT-S144-THY1.
 The present paper describes further mapping of the AT locus by means of a panel of 10 markers that span approximately 60 cM in the 11q22-23 region centered around S144 and THY1.
 Location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [S144-THY1] segment, as well as three contiguous segments telomeric to THY1, are each unlikely to contain the AT locus, while the more centromeric [STMY-S144] segment is most likely to contain the AT locus.
 These data, together with recent refinements in the linkage and physical maps of 11q22-23, place the AT locus at 11q23.
