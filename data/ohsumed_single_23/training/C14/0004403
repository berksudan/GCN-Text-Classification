Surgical treatment of endomyocardial fibrosis: a new approach.
 Endomyocardial fibrosis has been treated surgically for many years.
 For complete removal of fibrosis from both ventricles by the classic technique, each atrioventricular (AV) valve was removed and replaced with a prosthesis.
 Relapse of endomyocardial fibrosis has not been observed after surgical correction.
 Reoperations have been carried out because of complications of valve prostheses.
 A new surgical technique for removal of ventricular fibrous tissue with preservation of the mitral and tricuspid valves was used in nine consecutive patients with endomyocardial fibrosis.
 Initial results show a reduction of pulmonary hypertension, mean right and left atrial pressures and end-diastolic pressures in both ventricles.
 Tricuspid annuloplasty was performed in seven patients and mitral annuloplasty in five.
 No valve prosthesis was used.
 There was no death and New York Heart Association functional class improved from class III or IV in the preoperative period to class I or II in the postoperative period.
 These data suggest that resection of endocardial fibrous tissue can be indicated early in the clinical course and performed with preservation of the AV valves.
