Evidence of hibernating myocardium by a new transesophageal echocardiographic technique.
 Reversal of resting wall motion abnormalities after successful coronary angioplasty were documented in a patient with the use of a novel approach to stress testing.
 Transesophageal stress echocardiography utilizes transesophageal atrial pacing to provoke myocardial ischemia while the left ventricular contractility is being monitored by means of transesophageal echocardiography.
 The potential use of this technique is illustrated in this report.
