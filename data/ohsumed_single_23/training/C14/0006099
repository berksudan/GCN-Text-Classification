Protein phosphorylation during ischemia.
 Many investigations have shown that calcium and adenosine triphosphate are crucial to central nervous system functions.
 It is probable that alterations of these substances during central nervous system ischemia are involved in the processes that cause irreversible neural damage.
 Calcium regulates several protein kinases that are responsible for phosphorylation of proteins vital for many central nervous system functions.
 Using a rabbit spinal cord ischemia model, we found protein kinase C and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase were severely affected during the first hour of ischemia.
 Protein kinase A was not significantly affected.
 The time course of lost protein kinase C enzyme activity closely corresponded to irreversible loss of neurologic function, and there is evidence that protein kinase C inhibitor activity is generated.
 Also, drugs that inhibit protein kinase C increased neurologic damage when administered during the early phases of ischemia.
 These results suggest that protein phosphorylation, particularly by protein kinase C, is critical to maintenance of neurologic function.
