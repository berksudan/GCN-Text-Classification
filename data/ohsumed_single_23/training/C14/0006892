Repair of flail anterior leaflets of tricuspid and mitral valves by cusp remodeling.
 We present an alternative approach to extensive rupture of the chordae tendineae leading to flail anterior leaflets.
 Resection of the affected cusp segment, suture of the cut edges, and extensive plication of the segment of annulus devoid of leaflets abolished massive regurgitation while maintaining an adequate valve orifice.
