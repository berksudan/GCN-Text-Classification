Doppler diagnostics, indications, and control of surgical treatment in patients with carotid pathology.
 Major stroke is a relatively common cause of death or disabling invalidism in patients with atherosclerosis.
 In a large percentage of cases it is caused by stenotic/thrombotic processes in carotid arteries and this emphasizes the importance of the problem of early diagnosis and treatment of carotid pathology.
 Recently Doppler sonography has become a leading non-invasive method of early screening of stenotic processes in carotid arteries.
 The aim of the present study was to ascertain the diagnostic abilities of Doppler sonography for screening of carotid pathology, assessment of extra-cranial and intracranial hemodynamics, defining of indications, and control of vascular reconstructions of carotids.
