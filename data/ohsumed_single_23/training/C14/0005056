Embolization of a giant renal arterial aneurysm.
 A 49-year-old man presented with right flank pain.
 Angiography revealed a giant right renal arterial aneurysm.
 Giant renal arterial aneurysms are typically treated by nephrectomy.
 In this patient the aneurysm was embolized successfully with multiple Gianturco-Wallace coils and polyvinyl alcohol.
 This case indicates that embolization may be a reasonable alternative to nephrectomy.
