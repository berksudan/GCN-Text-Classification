Critical care transportation medicine: new concepts in pretransport stabilization of the critically ill patient.
 Regionalization of health care for trauma has become commonplace, and the same concept for critically ill medical/surgical patients is developing.
 Recent evidence suggests that current stabilization measures used by transport teams can be inadequate for this critically ill patient population.
 In trauma, speed has been considered a necessity to get the patient to a facility which cannot be carried out to the field, eg, an operating room.
 For acute medical illnesses, critical care transport teams can bring intensive care technology to the patient.
 Accumulating evidence supports the premise that speed of transport is not as important as stabilization before transport, knowledge of hemodynamics during transport, and early use of critical care monitoring systems.
 Other reports identify the need for initial evaluation and stabilization of critically ill patients by physicians at the critical care level of expertise.
 Accordingly, critical care transportation teams have evolved, creating new notions of pretransport stabilization not applicable to previous transport systems.
