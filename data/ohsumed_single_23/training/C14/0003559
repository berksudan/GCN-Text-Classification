Deferoxamine fails to improve postischemic cardiac function in hypertrophied hearts.
 Myocardial hypertrophy is a well-recognized risk factor in congenital cardiac surgery.
 Hypertrophied hearts have been demonstrated to have an increased vulnerability to ischemia/reperfusion injury.
 We studied the effects of the iron chelator and hydroxyl radical scavenger deferoxamine given during early reperfusion in a model of isolated retroperfused rabbit hearts made hypertrophic by aortic banding early in life (1 week of age).
 The rabbits were studied at 6-8 weeks of age, and the hearts were subjected to 30 minutes of 37 degrees C ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion.
 Postischemic recovery of isovolumic developed pressure was measured by using an intracavitary balloon in both the untreated (n = 6) and the deferoxamine-treated (n = 6) groups and compared with normal age-matched controls.
 Deferoxamine (50 mumol/kg) was given to one group with the hypertrophied hearts during the first 10 minutes of reperfusion.
 The left ventricular weight/body weight ratio in the hypertrophied hearts was 2.9 +/- 0.4 x 10(-3) (n = 14) versus 2.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) in the age-matched controls (p less than 0.05).
 Postischemic peak developed pressure recovered to 102 +/- 6% of the preischemic value in the normal hearts after 30 minutes of reperfusion compared with 75 +/- 5% for the untreated and 71 +/- 4% for the deferoxamine-treated hearts (p less than 0.05 vs.
 control).
 We conclude that chronic hypertrophy from early in life leads to increased susceptibility to ischemia and that the iron chelator deferoxamine is not effective in preventing the injury of reperfusion in hypertrophied hearts.
