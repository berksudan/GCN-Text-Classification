Circumferential quantitative analysis of planar 201T1 myocardial scintigraphy in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.
 Methodology for the computer analysis of 201T1 myocardial perfusion images has been developed by several laboratories.
 Substantial evidence of the advantage of this approach over visual inspection alone has been reported.
 The currently available computer analyses use different algorithms to analyze 201T1 kinetics in the myocardium.
 The authors evaluated and compared two widely used software programs, Medical Data System (MDS): a mean-count profile, and the Cedars Sinai (CS): a maximal-count profile, of planar 201T1 scintigraphy for their ability to detect coronary artery disease (CAD).
