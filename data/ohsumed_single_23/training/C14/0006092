Effect of ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion on superoxide dismutase activity in rat brain.
 Acute cerebral ischemia increases the generation of free radicals, causing cell damage, and theoretically may decrease the activity of the scavenging enzyme superoxide dismutase.
 To investigate the role of superoxide dismutase in cerebral ischemia, we used a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.
 In this model an infarct is produced in the pyriform and frontoparietal cortices, extending into the lateral basal ganglia.
 We measured superoxide dismutase activity by using the xanthine oxidase cytochrome c reduction assay in these areas of rat brains.
 Tissue samples were analyzed 20 minutes, 2, 6, or 24 hours, or 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion and 2 or 24 hours or 7 days after sham operation (n = 8-10 at each time).
 There was no significant change in superoxide dismutase activity relative to control values in any brain area at any time up to 24 hours after surgery.
 However, 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion a significant decline in superoxide dismutase activity, to 55%-68% (p less than 0.05) of that in unoperated controls, was observed in all brain areas.
 Our results do not support an important role for changes in the activity of endogenous superoxide dismutase during the acute phase of cerebral ischemia.
 However, the decrease in superoxide dismutase activity 7 days after ischemia could indicate ongoing additional damage to peri-infarct tissue.
