Use of the variable-length intraluminal sutureless graft.
 From August 1987 to May 1988 we treated 4 patients with acute ascending aortic dissections with a variable-length intraluminal aortic prosthesis.
 This operation uses profound hypothermic circulatory arrest and represents a refinement of existing techniques.
 There was no mortality, and morbidity was minimal.
 Modifications of this technique can be used in performing proximal aortic root reconstruction with a composite valved conduit.
 The use of a variable-length intraluminal prosthesis and hypothermic circulatory arrest is illustrated.
 This is a safe and useful technique in select cases of acute ascending aortic dissection.
