Systolic hypertension in the elderly: reasons not to treat.
 Isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
 Accurate measurement of blood pressure in older patients is difficult.
 Therapy can be associated with various complications, and the special problems of the elderly, such as orthostatic hypotension and hyperkalemia, should be carefully considered.
 Drugs should be used in low doses and changes in dosage should be made infrequently.
 Patients should be monitored frequently for untoward effects of therapy.
 The benefits of blood pressure reduction and the optimal degree of blood pressure reduction remain unknown.
