Apical segmental dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: subgroup with unique clinical features.
 A segmental wall motion abnormality is an unusual finding in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
 To clarify its clinical significance, 48 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were analyzed.
 Eight patients (Group A) had apical segmental dysfunction; 40 (Group B) had normal wall motion.
 No patient in either group had coronary artery stenosis on selective coronary arteriography.
 In all patients in Group A, apical segmental dysfunction was revealed by left ventriculography; however, it could be detected by echocardiography in only two patients in Group A.
 Left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram (ECG) was more common in Group B (p less than 0.05).
 Abnormal Q waves were more frequently discovered in Group A (p less than 0.005) and were recognized predominantly in the lateral leads.
 On serial ECGs, a gradual development of abnormal Q waves was noted in six of eight patients in Group A.
 Malignant arrhythmias were more common in Group A (p less than 0.001).
 In two patients in Group A, left ventricular dilation and congestive heart failure developed during the follow-up period.
 Thus, the presence of a Q wave in the lateral leads on an ECG in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may indicate the presence of apical segmental dysfunction.
 Left ventriculography should be performed to examine the presence of this abnormality and 24 h ambulatory ECG monitoring should be done to detect malignant arrhythmias in patients who have abnormal Q waves in the lateral leads.
 Patients with this unique type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy need careful follow-up evaluation.
