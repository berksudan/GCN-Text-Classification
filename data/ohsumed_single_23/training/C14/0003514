Excretion of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin metabolites before and after exercise testing in patients with and without signs of ischemic heart disease.
 We addressed the hypothesis that platelets are not activated in association with effort-induced myocardial ischemia in stable coronary disease.
 Seventy-two patients undergoing a diagnostic bicycle exercise test were stratified according to the development of chest pain (yes/no, 33/39) and of exercise-induced ST-segment depression of at least 200 microV in the electrocardiogram (yes/no, 12/60).
 Noninvasive indexes of platelet activation and of platelet/vessel wall interaction (urinary excretion of the 2,3-dinor-metabolites of thromboxane A2 [Tx-M] and prostacyclin [PGI-M], respectively) were analyzed in samples collected in the basal state and after the test.
 Basal Tx-M and PGI-M did not differ in patients with (236 +/- 35 and 131 +/- 22 pg/mg creatinine, respectively) and without (185 +/- 16 and 101 +/- 13 pg/mg creatinine, respectively) chest pain, or in those with (178 +/- 45 and 162 +/- 41 pg/mg, respectively) and without (216 +/- 22 and 104 +/- 11 pg/mg, respectively) ST-segment depression during the test.
 Patients without chest pain or without ST-segment depression moderately increased (p less than 0.05) their urinary Tx-M (by 21% and 13%, respectively) and PGI-M (by 28% and 23%, respectively) after exercise.
 No significant increases were observed in those developing chest pain or ST depression during exercise.
 These data indicate that effort-induced myocardial ischemia is not associated with an increase in platelet activation or platelet/vessel wall interaction in patients with stable coronary disease.
