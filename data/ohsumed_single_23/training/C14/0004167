Muscle oxidative capacity and work performance after training under local leg ischemia.
 Healthy young men executed supine one-legged cycle training four times per week for 4 wk with legs and the cycle ergometer inside a pressure chamber, the opening of which was sealed by a rubber membrane at the level of the crotch.
 Each training session started by training one leg under ischemic conditions induced by increased chamber pressure (50 mmHg) at the highest intensity tolerable for 45 min.
 Then the other leg was trained with the same power profile but normal atmospheric chamber pressure.
 Before and after the training period, both legs executed one-legged exercise tests under both normal and increased chamber pressure and muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis.
 Ischemic training increased performance more than normal training, the difference being greater for exercise executed under ischemic conditions.
 The difference in performance increase between the legs was paralleled by a greater muscle citrate synthase activity in the ischemically than in the normally trained leg.
