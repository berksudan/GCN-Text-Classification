How to select a drug for the long-term treatment of chronic heart failure.
 First-line drugs for the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure should produce immediate symptomatic benefit, improve exercise tolerance, and thereby improve the quality of life.
 They should preferentially be active as monotherapy or at least reduce the need for comedication.
 The drugs must be safe and well tolerated by patients and change, in the end, the natural history of the disease, so that sudden death will be prevented and life expectancy improves.
 None of the currently available drugs satisfies all these criteria.
 Diuretics, digitalis, converting-enzyme inhibitors, and ibopamine come close to the described ideal.
