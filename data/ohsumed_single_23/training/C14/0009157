Temporal relation between left ventricular dysfunction and chest pain in coronary artery disease during activities of daily living.
 Forty-three ambulatory patients with angina of increasing frequency underwent continuous monitoring of left ventricular (LV) function for an average of 2.9 +/- 1.9 hours to determine the incidence and temporal sequence of LV dysfunction, ST-segment depression and chest pain.
 Indicators of ischemia were: a decrease in ejection fraction greater than 5% lasting greater than 1 minute; horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression of greater than or equal to 1 mm; or onset of the patient's typical chest pain complex, or a combination of these.
 During the monitoring interval, subjects performed daily activities such as sitting, walking, climbing stairs and eating.
 In 11 patients, 22 episodes of chest pain or ST-segment depression, or both, were observed.
 Eighteen episodes were accompanied by a decrease in ejection fraction (9 patients); chest pain accompanied the decrease in ejection fraction during 13 episodes, whereas ST-segment changes occurred during 7.
 In 12 of 13 episodes the decrease in ejection fraction began earlier than the onset of chest pain, whereas in 1 patient ejection fraction decrease and chest pain onset started at the same time.
 The average interval from a decrease in ejection fraction to the onset of chest pain was 56 +/- 41 seconds (range 0 to 120).
 ST changes occurred after the onset of a decrease in ejection fraction in 6 of 7 episodes.
 The average interval from the onset of ejection fraction decrease and the onset of ST change was 99 +/- 91 seconds.
 These data suggest that LV dysfunction manifested by a decrease in ejection fraction is an earlier indicator of myocardial ischemia than is angina pectoris or electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia.
