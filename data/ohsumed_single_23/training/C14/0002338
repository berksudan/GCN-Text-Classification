Planar imaging techniques used with technetium-99m sestamibi to evaluate chronic myocardial ischemia.
 The results of published and some unpublished studies comparing planar imaging performed with 2 radionuclides, thallium-201 (T1-201) and technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi, are reviewed.
 The average sensitivity for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in studies involving 594 patients was 85% (range 73 to 96%).
 The average sensitivity for individual vessels was 65% (range 60 to 70%).
 The average segmental concordance between T1-201 and Tc-99m sestamibi was 89%.
 End-diastolic gated perfusion images improved the concordance between Tc-99m sestamibi and angiography in 22 patients from 83.4 to 87%.
 Semiquantitative analysis increased the concordance between T1-201 and Tc-99m sestamibi from 89 to 91%.
 Ventricular function derived from gated Tc-99m sestamibi perfusion images showed a significant correlation with echocardiography (n = 62, r = 0.85); with angiography (n = 70, r = 0.91); and with equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography (n = 18, r = 0.86).
 The ratio of lung to left ventricle uptake and the ratio of right ventricle to left ventricle uptake was assessed.
 Eight of 52 patients had an abnormally elevated lung index (greater than 42%) and these patients had the most severe CAD.
 Six of the 52 patients had an abnormally elevated right ventricular index (greater than 56%) and these patients had more severe CAD.
