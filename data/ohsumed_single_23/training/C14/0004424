Plaque morphology and pathologic changes in arteries from patients dying after coronary balloon angioplasty 
 Morphologic correlates of pathologic success or failure were studied at autopsy in 28 patients with 40 coronary arteries that had been subjected to balloon angioplasty.
 The presence of the following histologic features was evaluated: plaque concentricity or eccentricity, calcification, fibrous or fibropultaceous plaque, medial disruption, luminal thrombus and inflammation.
 Angioplasty was considered successful (residual cross-sectional luminal area greater than 25%) on pathologic examination in 14 arteries and unsuccessful in 26 arteries.
 Eccentric plaques were more likely to be successfully dilated than were concentric lesions (p less than 0.05).
 Six (50%) of 12 fibropultaceous plaques were successfully dilated compared with only 8 (29%) of 28 fibrous plaques.
 Moderate to severe calcification did not preclude morphologic success.
 Medial stretching or dissection, or both, was more often associated with a successful result.
 Thus, plaque morphology may be an important determinant of pathologic outcome after coronary angioplasty.
