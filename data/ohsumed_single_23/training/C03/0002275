Ascariasis.
 Ascaris lumbricoides is the most common helminth to infect humans.
 Infection occurs when contaminated soil containing mature eggs is swallowed.
 Clinically, infection ranges from the asymptomatic carrier state to life-threatening pulmonary disease or intestinal obstruction.
 Diagnosis is most frequently established by identification of the eggs in stool specimens.
 Treatment with antiparasitic drugs is effective in preventing serious complications and eradicating the parasite from all members of the household.
