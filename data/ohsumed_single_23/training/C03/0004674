Effects of albendazole on Echinococcus multilocularis infection in the Mongolian jird.
 Albendazole chemotherapy of larval Echinococcus multilocularis was studied in the Mongolian jird by administration of medicated feed at various concentrations and durations.
 The effects were evaluated by comparison of treated and control groups in terms of host mortality, larval metastases to the lungs, and final weight and histologic appearance of larval tissue.
 Viability of larval tissue at necropsy of each animal was tested by inoculation into two noninfected jirds.
 Albendazole-medicated feed (0.05%-0.10%) significantly inhibited larval growth.
 Other effects of the drug included larval degeneration and necrosis, inhibition of protoscolex formation, decreased pulmonary metastases, and reduced mortality of hosts.
 Adverse effects on the parasite correlated significantly with serum albendazole metabolite levels and duration of therapy.
 However, serum albendazole levels in jirds equal to or exceeding concentrations achieved in humans receiving daily doses of 10 mg/kg of body weight did not kill the parasite.
