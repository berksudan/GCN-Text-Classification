Visceral leishmaniasis in a Scottish child.
 A Scottish girl acquired visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) while on holiday in Majorca.
 She presented with the infection, six months later, in Scotland.
 Because of inexperience with the disease and a degree of scepticism unnecessary investigations were carried out resulting in a delay in treatment.
