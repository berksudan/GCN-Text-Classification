Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis acquired in Peru.
 A case of diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) acquired in Peru is described.
 The causative agent was Leishmania mexicana amazonensis as determined by isoenzyme analysis and species-specific monoclonal antibody binding characteristics.
 Histological examination of biopsy material showed a large number of intracellular and extracellular amastigotes and few lymphocytes.
 Treatment with meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) administered iv at a dosage of 20 mg antimony/kg body weight/day for 60 days resulted in visible improvement of the lesions, but not in clinical or parasitological cure.
