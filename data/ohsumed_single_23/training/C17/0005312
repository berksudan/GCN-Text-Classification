Cutaneous phototoxic occurrences in patients receiving Photofrin.
 Incidence of cutaneous phototoxic reactions induced by intravenous injection of Photofrin polyporphyrin was assessed in a series of 180 patients (266 injections) undergoing photodynamic therapy (PDT) at Roswell Park Cancer Institute during the period 1986-1989.
 In addition to the usual verbal questions regarding phototoxic reactions solicited at follow-up, forty-two patients in this group also responded to a written questionnaire designed to solicit answers to specific questions.
 Photofrin doses ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg.
 Overall, 20-40% of patients reported some type of phototoxic response.
