Prolonged remission after cyclosporine therapy in pemphigus vulgaris: report of two young siblings.
 We report the clinical evolution of two young siblings with severe pemphigus vulgaris treated with cyclosporine for 30 and 12 months, respectively.
 One was resistant to treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and azathioprine.
 A good clinical response was achieved in both cases.
 No major side effects were observed.
 The patients have remained disease free for more than 20 months after stopping cyclosporine therapy.
