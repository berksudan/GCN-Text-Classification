Ionizing radiation-induced pemphigus. Case presentations and literature review.
 Reports of pemphigus following ionizing radiation exposure are rare.
 We report two cases and review the literature regarding this association.
 Characteristics common to these cases include a prodromal persistent nonspecific dermatitic eruption that is often interpreted as radiation dermatitis, and latency of variable duration before the onset of a vesiculobullous eruption that begins at the portal of irradiation.
 Direct immunofluorescence is positive for intercellular IgG, while indirect immunofluorescence is commonly positive only at low titers; HLA correlations have not been studied.
 Documentation of clinical course and laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, including hematoxylin-eosin, direct and indirect immunofluorescence, and HLA determinations (if available), should be recorded to enable further clarification of this entity.
