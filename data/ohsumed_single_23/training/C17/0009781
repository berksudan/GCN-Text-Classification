Anti-(U1) small nuclear RNA antibodies in anti-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein sera from patients with connective tissue diseases.
 Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles are a class of RNA-containing particles in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.
 Sera from patients with connective tissue diseases often contain antibodies against the proteins present in these snRNPs.
 Antibodies against the RNA components of snRNPs, the U snRNAs, are thought to be rare.
 We tested 118 anti-snRNP sera for the presence of anti-snRNA antibodies and found them in 45 sera (38%).
 In all sera the antibodies (IgG and F(ab)2 fragments thereof) were exclusively directed against U1 snRNA.
 The anti-(U1) RNA antibodies were always accompanied by anti-(U1)RNP antibodies but were not found in sera which contain antibodies of the Sm serotype directed against all nucleoplasmic U snRNP particles.
 Like anti-RNP antibodies, anti-U1 RNA activity is confined to sera from patients with SLE or SLE overlap syndromes and is rarely found in patients with other connective tissue diseases.
 By analyzing binding to subfragments of U1 snRNA made in vitro, it was demonstrated that anti-(U1)RNA antibodies recognize epitopes distributed throughout the U1 RNA molecule.
 In most sera, however, either the second or the fourth hairpin loop is the main target of the antibody.
 The possible mechanisms that could lead to the production of this new type of autoantibody are discussed.
