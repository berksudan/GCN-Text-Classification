Abnormal essential fatty acid metabolism in Darier's disease.
 Fatty acid levels in plasma and erythrocyte cell membranes were determined in 13 Danish patients with Darier's disease and 21 Danish controls.
 Concentrations of the main dietary essential fatty acids, linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), were consistently modestly above normal; concentrations of the delta 6-desaturase metabolites of both linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, however, were consistently and often significantly below normal.
 These results suggest that the capacity of the enzyme delta 6-desaturase activity is inadequate in patients with Darier's disease.
