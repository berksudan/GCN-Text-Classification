Psoriasis: the application of genetic technology and mapping.
 Recent progress in molecular genetics has led to the creation of a map of the human genome utilizing RFLP.
 Given a sufficient family structure, genetic diseases can now be placed on this map.
 Genetic studies of psoriasis can both help resolve and be confounded by problems of disease heterogeneity, environmental effects on disease expression, and lack of a clear model of inheritance.
