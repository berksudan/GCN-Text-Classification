Effect of long-term PUVA treatment of psoriasis on the collagen and elastin gene expression and growth of skin fibroblasts in vitro.
 The proliferation rate, collagen metabolism and collagen and elastin messenger-RNA levels were studied in fibroblasts derived from patients who had received many courses of either systemic 8-methoxypsoralen or topical trioxsalen PUVA treatment.
 The proliferation rate of fibroblasts as measured by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine or by cellular division was decreased in those obtained from patients who had PUVA treatment as compared with controls.
 Collagen synthesis was slightly increased in the cells from PUVA-treated patients, but the relative collagen synthesis and the ratio between types I and III collagen were unchanged.
 The levels of collagen and elastin mRNAs were increased in fibroblasts derived from the PUVA-treated patients.
 No significant differences in histology or immunochemistry could be found in the biopsies taken from topical and systemic PUVA-treated patients.
