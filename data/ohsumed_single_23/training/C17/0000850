Localized hyperhidrosis in pretibial myxedema.
 Two cases of spontaneous hyperhidrosis limited to pretibial myxedema lesions were studied.
 Quantitative measurements of stimulated eccrine sweat were made after the intradermal injection of methacholine.
 The sweat rate was two to four times greater in the lesional skin than in perilesional skin.
 Eccrine secretory glands in excisional biopsy specimens from the pretibial lesions were significantly larger than those in perilesional skin.
 To our knowledge, hyperhidrosis localized to areas of pretibial myxedema has not been reported.
