Submammary median sternotomy.
 A vertical skin incision is used as routine approach for sternotomy.
 The resulting scar is often disappointing and the top is visible and unpleasant, especially for young women.
 In 35 women ranging from 10 to 48 years (mean 29.2 years), median sternotomy was performed via a submammary skin incision.
 In all cases an open heart surgical procedure was performed.
 Adequate exposure of the heart was achieved in every case and there were no technical problems related to this approach, no hospital mortality or major complications.
 The cosmetic result is excellent and this approach is certainly justified in open heart surgery for young women.
