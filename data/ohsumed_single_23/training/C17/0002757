Basophil histamine release and airway response to mite allergen in atopic dermatitis.
 Twelve patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) were subjected to in vitro histamine release from peripheral blood leukocytes (basophils) and in vivo bronchial inhalation challenge using house dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae) allergen.
 Not only seven patients with asthmatic history but also five patients without asthma responded to both the in vitro and the in vivo challenges.
 A significant correlation was observed between HR30 (a mite concentration producing a 30% release of total cellular histamine) and PC20 allergen (a mite concentration producing a 20% fall in FEV1).
 There was also a significant correlation between MHR (maximal histamine release) and the maximal fall in FEV1.
 The relationship held for both AD patients with asthma and without asthma.
 These results suggest that histamine release induced by the house dust mite allergen is a good in vitro test for predicting the bronchial response to this allergen.
 They also suggest that these tests are not disease specific, but are valuable in evaluating the degree of atopic state in a subject.
