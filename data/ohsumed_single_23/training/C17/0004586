Lymphocyte chemoattractants in psoriasis and normal skin.
 The local production of lymphocyte attractants may influence both physiologic lymphocyte trafficking in the skin as well as the infiltration of these cells in pathologic states.
 Recent evidence for the production of acidic lipid lymphocyte chemoattractants, particularly 12[R]-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, in psoriatic lesions is reviewed.
 Water extractable lymphocyte attractant activity may also be recovered from both normal skin samples and psoriatic lesional stratum corneum, and may be important in the pathophysiology of lymphocyte trafficking.
 Less than 10 kD activity from normal skin has undergone the most detailed characterization.
 This has led to the isolation of a novel, as yet unidentified compound from normal skin, which we have termed "plasma-associated lymphocyte chemoattractant" (PALC).
