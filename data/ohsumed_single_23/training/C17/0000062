Neutrophil zinc levels in psoriasis and seborrhoeic dermatitis.
 The median zinc content of neutrophils was significantly reduced in 16 patients with psoriasis in comparison to both normal controls and six patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis (P less than 0.05).
 This reduction was unrelated to the extent of skin involvement.
 Plasma and erythrocyte zinc levels were unchanged.
