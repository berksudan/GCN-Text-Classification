Piroxicam-induced photosensitivity and contact sensitivity to thiosalicylic acid.
 A photocontact dermatitis developed in three patients after the application of gel containing 0.5% piroxicam.
 Patch tests were positive to thiomersal and thiosalicylic acid.
 Photopatch tests with piroxicam at several concentrations were positive in the three patients but negative in 62 normal volunteer subjects.
 Patch tests performed on 14 patients with proved systemic photosensitivity to piroxicam were positive for thiomersal and thiosalicylic acid.
 Nine of 12 patients previously sensitized to thiosalicylic acid and with no history of exposure to piroxicam showed positive photopatch test reactions to this chemical.
 These results support a relation between piroxicam-induced photosensitivity and contact sensitivity to thiosalicylic acid.
 Contact allergic sensitivity to the latter is a marker for patients with a high risk of developing photosensitivity reactions to piroxicam.
 These reactions may be due to photoproducts of the drug rather than metabolites.
