The natural history of Peyronie's disease.
 The natural history of Peyronie's disease was evaluated in 97 men by means of a questionnaire.
 Disease duration ranged from 3 months to 8 years.
 Questions addressed pain, bending, ability for intercourse, over-all effect of the disease, psychological effects, treatments received and degree of disease progression.
 Approximately 40% of the patients found pain, bending, ability for intercourse and over-all effects to be unchanged during the course of the disease.
 Bending and ability for relations worsened in 40% of the patients during the same interval, while only 6% had worsening of pain.
 Of the patients 77% reported psychological effects due to Peyronie's disease, which improved in 28%, did not change in 36% and worsened in 36%.
 Over-all, 13% of the patients believed the disease to be one of gradual resolution, 47% believed there had been little or no change and 40% believed that the disease pattern was one of gradual progression.
 We found no statistically significant association between disease duration and spontaneous improvement in penile bending.
 A similar lack of statistical significance was found when improvement in a variety of categories was compared in patients who received no therapy versus those who received a variety of conventional medical therapies.
