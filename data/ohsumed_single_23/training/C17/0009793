Multiple keratoacanthomas treated with oral retinoids.
 Multiple eruptive keratoacanthoma of Witten and Zak is a rare disorder characterized by numerous small, eruptive tumors and larger, more typical keratoacanthomas.
 Affected patients have features of Grzybowski-type keratoacanthomas and Ferguson Smith type.
 Two patients with multiple keratoacanthomas were treated with oral retinoids.
 Both patients had hundreds of follicular papules on the trunk and extremities.
 Less common lesions included nodules with central horn-filled craters more characteristic of classic keratoacanthomas.
 Retinoid therapy resulted in regression of the larger, more typical keratoacanthomas in both patients.
 The small follicular keratoacanthomas remained unaffected.
 Thus oral retinoids are only partially beneficial for the treatment of the Grzybowski type or the Witten and Zak type of multiple eruptive keratoacanthomas.
