Autoantibodies from patients with localized and generalized bullous pemphigoid immunoprecipitate the same 230-kd keratinocyte antigen.
 Two patients demonstrating the typical clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic features of nonscarring localized bullous pemphigoid are described.
 These patients possess circulating IgG autoantibodies that bind the epidermal side of 1.0-mol/L sodium chloride-split human skin in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy.
 Immunnoprecipitation studies demonstrate that these patients have circulating autoantibodies that immunoprecipitate the same 230-kd bullous pemphigoid antigen that is precipitated by autoantibodies from patients with generalized bullous pemphigoid.
 These findings indicate that localized bullous pemphigoid is a true clinical variant of generalized pemphigoid rather than a separate nosologic entity.
