Digital imaging techniques in dermatology.
 Digital imaging is a versatile technique that has been infrequently used in dermatology to record visual images.
 We have used this technology for 10 patients to follow cutaneous lesions, including alopecia mucinosa, psoriasis, and dysplastic nevi.
 The setup included a personal computer, digitizer board, monitor, video camera, and lights.
 An introduction to electronic (digital) imaging is given and some of the many possible applications in dermatology are discussed.
