Treatment of hirsutism with the pure antiandrogen flutamide.
 The effectiveness of the antiandrogen flutamide in combination with an oral contraceptive was studied in 20 patients with moderate to severe hirsutism.
 Eight patients had no previous therapy, whereas 12 had failed to respond to oral contraceptives, spironolactone, or dexamethasone therapy.
 Treatment with the antiandrogen flutamide (250 mg twice daily) and an oral contraceptive (Ortho 1/35) resulted in a particularly rapid and marked decrease in the total hirsutism score, which reached the normal range at 7 months.
 Seborrhea, acne, and hair loss score were also rapidly corrected.
 Treatment was associated with a decrease in plasma luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and estradiol levels.
 Plasma sex hormone-binding globulin levels were initially low in 18 to 20 patients but increased significantly during therapy.
 No clinically significant side effects were observed.
