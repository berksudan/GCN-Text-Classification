Itraconazole in the treatment of tinea capitis.
 Fifty patients with tinea capitis were treated with itraconazole, 25 to 100 mg/day, for 20 to 73 days in six countries.
 Forty-seven patients (94%) responded clinically (healed or markedly improved) to therapy, of which 38 patients (76%) completely healed and 9 patients (18%) markedly improved.
 Three patients (6%) failed therapy.
 Forty-two patients were assessable for mycologic examination; 38 patients (93%) converted mycologically to negative and 4 patients (7%) remained positive for organisms.
 In one group of 20 patients treated for 30 days, 6 patients were clinically and mycologically healed.
 By the 2-week follow-up visit 9 additional patients were healed, and 4 weeks after treatment all 20 patients were both clinically and mycologically healed.
 The primary organisms reported were Microsporum canis and Trichophyton tonsurans.
 Only one patient reported a possible side effect (tired legs).
 Laboratory values were all within normal limits, except for one patient who had a transient and slight increase in serum transaminase level.
 Low-dose itraconazole appears to be safe and effective in the treatment of tinea capitis.
