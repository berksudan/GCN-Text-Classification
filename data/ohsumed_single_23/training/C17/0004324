Treatment of molluscum contagiosum using a lidocaine/prilocaine cream (EMLA) for analgesia.
 Eighty-three 4- to 12-year-old children, scheduled for curettage of at least five molluscum contagiosum lesions, participated in a double-blind study.
 The children were randomly allocated to receive lidocaine/prilocaine (EMLA) cream (n = 58) or placebo cream (n = 25), applied 15, 30, or 60 minutes before treatment.
 The pain was assessed by the children and the physician as none, slight, moderate, or severe.
 In addition, the children rated the pain on a visual analog scale.
 EMLA cream effectively prevented the pain after all three application times (p less than 0.01).
 No significant difference in pain was observed among the 15-, 30-, and 60-minute EMLA-treated groups, but the proportion of children reporting no pain on the verbal scale increased from 36% in the 15-minute group to 61% in the 60-minute group.
 In the placebo group, only one of 24 children (4%) reported no pain.
 Transient local redness was the only skin reaction noted.
 In conclusion, an application time of EMLA cream of less than 60 minutes is satisfactory for the curettage of molluscum contagiosum in children.
