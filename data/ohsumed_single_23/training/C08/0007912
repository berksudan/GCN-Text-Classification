Bilious pleural effusion following liver biopsy.
 Pleural effusions in patients with chronic liver disease are common and usually are of little consequence.
 Bilious pleural effusion can occur following percutaneous biopsy or cholangiography procedures if the pleura is traversed.

 We discuss the laboratory evidence supporting the diagnosis of bilious effusion and review the reported experience with this complication.
