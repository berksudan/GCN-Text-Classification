Effects of prostaglandin E1 on platelet attenuation of oxidant-induced edema in isolated rabbit lungs.
 Numerous studies suggest that platelets may contribute to preservation of normal endothelial cell permeability in models of lung injury.
 We have previously shown that washed human platelets prevent xanthine oxidase-induced edema in the isolated perfused lung and that protective mechanisms depend on the platelet glutathione redox cycle.
 It is uncertain, however, whether platelets preserve endothelial function by reducing toxic oxygen metabolites or by aggregating and releasing endothelial cell supportive factors-an activity that may require the glutathione redox cycle.
 In this study, we present data demonstrating that platelet prevention of oxidant lung injury occurs independent of platelet aggregation and release.
 Isolated rabbit lungs perfused with a cell-free medium were instilled with purine (2 mmol/L) and xanthine oxidase (0.003 U/ml) to generate oxidant lung edema.
 The infusion of washed human platelets (1 x 10(10) cells) prevented lung edema formation as measured by lung weight gain, wet-to-dry lung weight ratios, and lung histology.
 Incubation of platelets with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and release, did not inhibit platelet attenuation of lung edema.
 Additionally, with the instillation of PGE1 into the perfusate to further inhibit platelet aggregation, no prevention of lung protection by PGE1-treated platelets was seen when these results were compared with those from studies in which lungs were infused with xanthine oxidase and PGE1.
 Aggregometry studies documented that the inhibitory effect of PGE1 on platelet aggregation persisted for up to 60 minutes, which was the duration of the isolated lung protocol.
 We conclude that platelet aggregation and release of platelet factors is not required for platelet attenuation of oxidant lung edema.
