Treatment of atelectasis of upper lung lobes. Selective bronchial suctioning with J-shaped catheter tip and guide mark.
 We developed a technique for blind bronchial suction using a curved-tip catheter with a guide mark, for the treatment of atelectasis of the lower and middle lobes of the lung.
 Suction of the upper lobe bronchi could not be performed because of the combination of the peculiar anatomy of the upper lobe bronchi with catheter design.
 We treated successfully two cases of atelectasis of the right upper lobes using a Rusch Metras bronchography catheter with a guide mark which is not readily available.
 Therefore we devised a J-shape tipped catheter with a guide mark.
 We have successfully treated 13 episodes of atelectasis of the right upper lobe in 10 patients and one episode in the left upper lobe in one patient with this new catheter.
