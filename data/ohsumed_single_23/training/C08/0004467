Platelet-activating factor- and leukotriene B4-induced release of lactoferrin from blood neutrophils of atopic and nonatopic individuals.
 We found increased accumulation of neutrophils and their components, lactoferrin (Lf) and elastase, as well as platelet-activating factor (PAF) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) at sites of ongoing human allergic reactions.
 To determine whether PAF or LTB4, could be the stimulus for in vivo Lf release, blood neutrophils of 17 subjects were incubated with PAF, LTB4, or the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and the released Lf (ELISA assay) was compared with spontaneous release.
 Significantly increased Lf release was induced by PAF, 10(-5) to 10(-8) mol/L (p less than 0.002); LTB4, 10(-7) to 10(-8) mol/L (p less than 0.004); and PMA (0.05 micrograms/ml) in a dose-dependent reaction.
 Cytochalasin was not required for Lf secretion but did enhance such responses.
 PAF-induced Lf secretion was inhibited by the specific PAF antagonist, BN 52063.
 More Lf was released from neutrophils of atopic than from nonatopic subjects in response to PAF, 10(-6) mol/L (4.2 micrograms/ml +/- 0.2 versus 2.6 micrograms/ml +/- 0.2; p less than 0.001) but not to LTB4, PMA, or buffer (p, not significant).
 We conclude that (1) PAF and LTB4 released in vivo could stimulate local neutrophils to release Lf with possible pathogenic effects and (2) neutrophils of atopic subjects are more responsive to PAF than neutrophils of nonatopic subjects in this regard.
