The adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 The adult respiratory distress syndrome remains an enigmatic disorder with a high mortality rate, although it can sometimes be managed effectively.
 Recognizing the conditions with which it is associated is the first step in preventing its occurrence.
 Decreasing the risk factors of developing ARDS remains the fundamental goal of initial management.
 Once the syndrome has developed in a particular patient, the clinician's goals in management are to stabilize the patient, avoid further insults, maximize the support therapies available, and be cognizant of and avoid the potential adverse effects of these supportive therapies.
