Mechanical disruption of pulmonary emboli in dogs with a flexible rotating-tip catheter (Kensey catheter).
 Pulmonary embolism was induced in 11 dogs by the injection of three- to four-day-old allogeneic blood clots.
 The clots were made radiopaque by soaking them in contrast material.
 The resulting clots were firm, 3 to 4 cm long, and 1 cm in diameter.
 Injection of the clots into the external jugular vein consistently produced occlusion of at least one of the lobar pulmonary arteries.
 In every instance in which the tip of the catheter could be positioned at the clot embolus (six dogs), the clots were readily fragmented with a number 8 French (2.67 mm OD) flexible rotating tip catheter (Kensey catheter) activated at 80,000 rpm.
 Overall perfusion was shown by posttreatment angiograms to be markedly improved.
 These studies show that catheter-tip fragmentation of pulmonary emboli with a Kensey catheter has excellent potential for therapeutic application in patients with pulmonary embolism.
