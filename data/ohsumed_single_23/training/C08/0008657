Ventilator dependency in the United Kingdom.
 There are 24 children who are currently long term ventilator dependent in the UK.
 Nine of these are cared for entirely at home.
 An additional 11 children have been long term ventilator dependent since March 1983.
 The prevalence of these children appears to be increasing.
 The financial and manpower resources needed for these children whether at home or in hospital is considerable.
 There are reasons to suppose that the apparent increase in prevalence will continue.
