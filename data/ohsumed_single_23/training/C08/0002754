Additive effect of albuterol and ipratropium bromide in the treatment of bronchospasm in children.
 Inhaled albuterol (A) (salbutamol) alone and albuterol plus ipratropium bromide (IB) were administered to 12 asthmatic children.
 Following administration of A alone or in combination with IB, there was a significant increase in FEV1 and FEF.
 Significant statistical difference in favor of the association A plus IB was observed at 120 and 240 minutes for FEV1 and in the period 120, 180, and 240 minutes for FEF.
 The additive effect was present both in the large and small airways.
 The short-lived additive effect of A plus IB suggests the opportunity to increase the frequency of drug administration in patients with severe bronchial obstruction.
