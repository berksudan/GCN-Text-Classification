Trimming of the inferior turbinates: a prospective long-term study.
 The aim of this study was to determine whether the initial benefits of radical trimming and anterior trimming of the inferior turbinates on nasal airflow persisted in the long term.
 Radical trimming significantly reduced nasal resistance at 2 months following operation (n = 12) (P less than 0.005).
 There was no significant change in nasal resistance over the next 20 months.
 Symptom scores for nasal obstruction also showed a significant reduction (n = 16) (P less than 0.005), at 2 months, and did not change significantly over the next 20 months.
 Radical trimming of the inferior turbinates is a highly effective operation in patients with hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates with few initial complications.
 However, further analysis of the data revealed that up to 20% of patients lose the initial subjective benefit of relief of nasal obstruction within 2 years of follow-up.
 Late onset crusting occurs in some patients though this is not directly attributable to an increase in nasal airflow.
 This study also concludes that anterior trimming of the inferior turbinates cannot be recommended as a form of treatment.
