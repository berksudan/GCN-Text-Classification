Lactate levels as predictors of the relationship between oxygen delivery and consumption in ARDS.
 We reviewed the changes in Do2 and Vo2 in 58 patients with ARDS after interventions which included fluid loading, blood transfusion, and PEEP.
 After a significant change in Do2, patients with lactic acidosis (lactate level greater than 2.4 mmol/L) exhibited significant corresponding changes in Vo2 (p less than 0.001); however, no change in Vo2 was observed in patients without lactic acidosis (1-beta greater than 0.8).
 We conclude that a biphasic pattern of oxygen utilization in patients with ARDS emerges when subsets of patients with and without lactic acidosis are compared.
 Lactic acidosis, a marker of anaerobic metabolism, may be a characteristic of patients with ARDS who exhibit changes in Vo2 that are dependent on changes in Do2.
