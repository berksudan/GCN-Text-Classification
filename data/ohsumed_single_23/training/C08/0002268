Inhaler and spacer use in obstructive airway diseases.
 The role of inhaled aerosols in the treatment of obstructive airway diseases is increasing for both immediate bronchodilation and prophylactic anti-inflammatory effects.
 Inhaled aerosol agents are available in metered-dose inhaler and nebulizer forms.
 Maximum therapeutic benefit from metered-dose inhalers is assured when the correct inhaler technique is used.
 Spacer devices may be helpful in some patients.
