The effect of rifampicin on rhinoscleroma: an electron microscopic study.
 Twenty-five cases suffering from rhinoscleroma were divided into two groups.
 The first group consisted of 15 patients treated with rifampicin systemically.
 The other group consisted of 10 patients treated locally with rifampicin in the form of ointment.
 Electron microscopic study of the pathological changes in the lesions showed that rifampicin is highly effective both systemically and locally in the treatment of rhinoscleroma.
