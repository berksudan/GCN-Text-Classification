Bombesin stimulation of mitogenesis. Specific receptors, signal transduction, and early events.
 Quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells can be stimulated to recommence DNA synthesis by polypeptide growth factors, neuropeptides, and various pharmacologic agents that act via multiple signal transduction pathways.
 Neuropeptides of the bombesin family provide potent mitogens to elucidate these pathways.
 These peptides bind to specific receptors that have been characterized by radioligand binding and sensitivity to antagonists and identified as glycoproteins with a Mr of 75,000-85,000 by chemical cross-linking.
 After binding, bombesin elicits a cascade of early molecular events including stimulation of phosphorylation of the acidic Mr 80,000 cellular protein, which is a major substrate of protein kinase C; Ca2+ mobilization mediated by Ins(1,4,5)P3, Na+ and K+ fluxes, transmodulation of EGF receptor, enhancement of cAMP accumulation, and expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc.
 Studies using membrane preparations and permeabilized 3T3 cells indicate that G proteins play a role in the transduction of the mitogenic signal triggered by the binding of bombesin to its receptor.
 A pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein couples the bombesin receptor to the generation of a signal that activates protein kinase C, whereas a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein mediates cross-talk between transmembrane signaling pathways.
 Bombesin-mediated mitogenesis can be blocked by different antagonists and by interrupting the signal-transduction process at various postreceptor levels.
 Thus, prolonged treatment with vasopressin causes heterologous desensitization to the mitogenic action of bombesin.
 This mitogenic block is mediated by uncoupling the receptor from its signaling system.
 Loss of responsiveness to bombesin-stimulated DNA synthesis is also induced by down-regulation of protein kinase C.
