Selection and evaluation of recipients for heart-lung and lung transplantation.
 Heart-lung and lung transplantation is being successfully performed with increasing frequency in patients with end-stage cardiopulmonary and pulmonary disease.
 Transplantation must now be considered as a therapeutic option in selected patients, and physicians are required to understand the principles involved for determining suitable candidates and operative procedures of choice.
 Indications, contraindications, and choice of operation with respect to underlying disease are discussed herein, as are methods of evaluation and appropriate timing for transplantation.
 Special considerations regarding specific patient populations are also addressed.
 In properly selected patients, heart-lung and lung transplantation provide a viable therapeutic option in those with end-stage disease who are unresponsive to conventional management.
