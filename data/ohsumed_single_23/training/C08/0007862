Pentoxifylline attenuates edema formation in proteolytic enzyme-induced lung injury.
 Ex vivo canine lung lobes were exposed to a pancreatic proteolytic enzyme (chymotrypsin) alone or chymotrypsin after pretreatment with a continuous infusion with pentoxifylline.
 The lobes exposed to chymotrypsin gained 133 g, while the pentoxifylline-treated lobes gained only 65 g (p less than .05) over the 3-h experimental period.
 These results suggest that pentoxifylline significantly attenuates the lung weight gain associated with chymotrypsin.
