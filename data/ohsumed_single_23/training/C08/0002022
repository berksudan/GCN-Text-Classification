MR imaging of the bird's nest filter.
 The appearance of the Bird's Nest inferior vena cava filter on magnetic resonance (MR) images of 11 patients is described.
 No complication or symptomatic filter displacement was encountered as a result of MR imaging performed at 1.5 T.
 The filters created significant local artifact and distortion on MR images.
 However, diagnostic MR images of the pelvis, spine, and brain may still be obtained.
