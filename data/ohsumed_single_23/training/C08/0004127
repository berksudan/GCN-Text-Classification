Hydraulic conductivity of canine parietal pleura in vivo.
 The hydraulic conductivity (Lp) of the parietal pleura was measured in vivo in spontaneously breathing anesthetized dogs in either the supine (n = 8) or the prone (n = 7) position and in an excised portion of the chest wall in which the pleura and its adjacent tissue were intact (n = 3).
 A capsule was glued to the exposed parietal pleura after the intercostal muscles were removed.
 The capsule was filled with either autologous plasma or isotonic saline.
 Transpleural fluid flow (V) was measured at several transpleural hydrostatic pressures (delta P) from the rate of meniscus movement within a graduated pipette connected to the capsule.
 Delta P was defined as the measured difference between capsule and pleural liquid pressures.
 The Lp of the parietal pleura was calculated from the slope of the line relating V to delta P by use of linear regression analysis.
 Lp in vivo averaged 1.36 X 10(-3) +/- 0.45 X 10(-3) (SD) ml.h-1.cmH2O-1.cm-2, regardless of whether the capsule was filled with plasma or saline and irrespective of body position.
 This value was not significantly different from that measured in the excised chest wall preparation (1.43 X 10(-3) +/- 1.1 X 10(-3) ml.h-1.cmH2O-1.cm-2).
 The parietal pleura offers little resistance to transpleural protein movement, because there was no observed difference between plasma and saline.
 We conclude that because the Lp for intact parietal pleura and extrapleural interstitium is approximately 100 times smaller than that previously measured in isolated stripped pleural preparations, removal of parietal pleural results in a damaged preparation.
