Bronchodilator response to ipratropium bromide in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 Although the muscarinic antagonist Ipratropium bromide is used clinically as a bronchodilator in infants ventilated because of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), no studies have compared the response or efficacy of different dosages or its effectiveness in combination with beta-adrenergic agonists.
 We measured the response of respiratory system mechanics in 10 ventilated infants (25 +/- 2 days of age) to 75, 125, and 175 micrograms ipratropium bromide (IB), 125 micrograms IB plus 0.04 mg salbutamol (SAL), 175 micrograms IB plus 0.04 mg SAL, and saline vehicle, delivered via nebulizer into the ventilator circuit.
 Respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and compliance (Crs) were measured by the passive flow-volume technique.
 Rrs and Crs were measured before and at 1 to 2 h and at 4 h after delivery of the five drug dosages or saline.
 All six studies were completed within a 72-h period.
 Saline had no significant effect on mechanics.
 Significant responses to ipratropium alone were seen only after 175 micrograms where Rrs decreased 20 +/- 3% (SEM) (p less than 0.05) at 1 to 2 h and 16 +/- 5% (p less than 0.05) at 4 h.
 After 125 micrograms IB + SAL and 175 micrograms IB + SAL, Rrs was significantly decreased both at 1 to 2 h and at 4 h, and Crs was significantly increased 20 +/- 6% and 20 +/- 4%, respectively, at 1 to 2 h.
 The greatest decrease in Rrs (26 +/- 6%) was seen 1 to 2 h after 175 micrograms IB + salbutamol.
