Methacholine responsiveness among working populations. Relationship to smoking and airway caliber.
 It has been suggested that the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in some smokers may be an intermediate event in the progression to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in this group.
 If this is true, prevalence data on BHR in a general population should show an independent association between BHR and smoking status.
 To test this, we analyzed BHR to inhaled methacholine in 654 white men without known asthma, in relation to smoking, skin-test reactivity, type of work (office versus industrial), and indicators of baseline airway caliber (FEV1 % predicted and FEV1/FVC).
 BHR was measured in the traditional way (PC20) and as the slope of FEV1 versus the methacholine concentration (linear scale).
 A PC20 of less than 16 mg/ml was considered "responsive" for analyses of this outcome.
 We found that although a positive skin test, smoking, and being an industrial worker all appeared to be significant predictors of increased BHR (p less than 0.05), once FEV1 (% predicted) and FEV1/FVC% were taken into account, none of these variables alone remained significantly associated with BHR.
 The strongest predictors of BHR were prechallenge FEV1 and FEV1/FVC (both p less than 0.01).
 The combination of smoking, atopy, and work groups, which identified a small subgroup of atopic smokers who were office workers, also remained significantly associated with increased BHR.
 We also used a regression model that allowed for comparison of predictors for BHR between the most responsive subset of the population (n = 84) and the remainder of the study population.
