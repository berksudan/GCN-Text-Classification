Surgical treatment for secondary retracted nose.
 This surgical technique is presented to correct nasal tip retraction, which is frequently associated with other surgical sequelae that can be corrected simultaneously.
 It is based on the use of a shield, an anchor, or half an anchor of otocartilage, with one or two posterior supports that are sutured together forming a small L and are fixed to the bed to project the nasal tip and, if necessary, to correct the unilateral or bilateral alar collapse.
