Pulmonary masses: contrast enhancement.
 Radiographic studies to discriminate benign from malignant pulmonary masses have previously focused on the morphologic and, more recently, the computed tomographic (CT) attenuation characteristics of the lung mass.
 Experience with the use of an intravenously administered iodinated contrast medium in examining the enhancement properties of lung masses was reviewed.
 Distinctive differences in the vascularity, pathophysiologic features, and pharmacodynamics of malignant versus benign pulmonary masses were identified.
 Forty-five patients with peripheral pulmonary masses were examined.
 Enhancement was evaluated by means of optical density values measured on trispiral tomograms of the lung masses before and after bolus injection of contrast medium.
 Results suggest that contrast enhancement of pulmonary masses can be measured on sectional images and that this may become a feasible diagnostic method in the detection of lung cancer.
 CT offers a simplified technique that is now being explored by the authors.
