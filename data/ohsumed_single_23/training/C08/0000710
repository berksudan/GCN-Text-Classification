Changes in self-concept during pulmonary rehabilitation, Part 1.
 The purpose of this two-part study was to describe changes in self-concept during and after a formal pulmonary rehabilitation program.
 A 20-item semantic meaning differential scale was administered to 37 patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were participating in a multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program.
 Patients were asked to evaluate their past, present, and future selves on program admission, on program discharge, and 2 to 6 months after home discharge.
 Mean total self-concept score for the present self significantly increased between program admission and home discharge 3 weeks later (mean change 31.32 +/- 22.04, p less than 0.0001).
 No significant declines in self-concept were found 2 to 6 months after home discharge (p = 0.39).
 Men showed a significantly higher change in total self-concept score than women during the 3-week program (p = 0.03).
 However, the men's change score dropped significantly after home discharge (p = 0.02), suggesting a need for more intensive follow-up care than with women.
 The self-concept tool in this study provided an easy way to monitor subjective changes in psychologic status.
