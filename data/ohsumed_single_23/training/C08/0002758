Exercise-induced biphasic responses and methacholine reactivity in asthma.
 Biphasic (early and late) asthmatic responses to exercise occurred in seven of 43 children with reproducible exercise-induced asthma.
 As biphasic allergen-induced asthma is associated with a prolonged increase in nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity, this effect was not sought in the 43 asthmatic children.
 There was no significant change in methacholine PD20 FEV1 before and after exercise challenge, either in children who had early, or early and late, exercise responses.
 Late reactions after allergen exposure are likely to be of considerable clinical significance in relation to the enhancement of bronchial responsiveness.
 It is reassuring that this is not the case for exercise challenge, as it would have major implications in relation to the recommendations that asthmatics should participate in normal activities and even in training programs.
 Furthermore, it suggests that there are differences between the pathophysiology of asthma induced by exercise and that produced by allergens.
