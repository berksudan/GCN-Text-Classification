Changes in self-concept during pulmonary rehabilitation, Part 2.
 This two-part study describes changes in self-concept during pulmonary rehabilitation.
 A 20-item semantic meaning differential scale was administered to 37 patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were participating in a multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program.
 Patients were asked to evaluate their past, present, and future self-concepts on program admission, on program discharge, and 2 to 6 months after home discharge.
 In this part of the study item-level quantitative data as well as qualitative data from the counseling session at program discharge are reported.
 The quantitative data documented detailed changes in self-concept at various stages of pulmonary rehabilitation.
 Counseling session results indicated that patient involvement in item-level analysis greatly facilitates psychosocial intervention.
 Findings from this study establish clinical indications for use of the Self-concept Evaluation tool in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Use of this tool is recommended early in the rehabilitation process.
