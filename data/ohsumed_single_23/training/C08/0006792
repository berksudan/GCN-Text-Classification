Systems architecture for quantification of dynamic myoelectric and kinematic activity of the human vocal tract.
 This paper describes a systems architecture useful for scientific investigations that require the acquisition and analysis of multiple, time-synchronous signals in large volume.
 The architecture has recently been developed by this group to enhance our capability to research and quantify central nervous system function in the production of normal and pathologic speech.
 The architecture utilizes modern advances in desktop microcomputers and has been designed so that vocal motor control laboratories (or similar settings) with modest funding can more fully participate in comprehensive investigations of speech production.
 Research experiments organized with this architecture may involve many more subjects and measures than previously possible without significant increases in time and personnel resources.
 This paper will demonstrate the technique and practicality of this architecture as it is being used to successfully guide research to map hierarchic central nervous system regions of involvement in two speech disorders: spasmodic dysphonia and stuttering.
 The architecture has broad usefulness to many areas of otolaryngology and health science.
