Avoiding a wrapped endotracheal tube in laser laryngeal surgery: experiences with apneic anesthesia and metal laser-flex endotracheal tubes.
 Ninety-one laser laryngeal procedures using the apneic technique of anesthesia were performed in 28 patients between 2 months and 64 years of age.
 Seventy-two procedures (79%) were performed on children and 19 on adults.
 There were no complications.
 Eight laser laryngoscopies were performed using a new metal Laser-Flex endotracheal tube.
 Obstruction of the endotracheal tube with a mucous plug occurred in one case.
 The apneic technique described in this paper provides a laser operative field free of an endotracheal tube, virtually eliminating the danger of a laser fire.
 It is a relatively safe and effective means of performing laser laryngeal surgery.
 In addition, the Laser-Flex endotracheal tube appears to be an acceptable alternative to a metallic tape-wrapped endotracheal tube.
