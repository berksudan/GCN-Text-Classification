Pulmonary lipid peroxidation in cigarette smokers and lung cancer patients.
 Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was studied in lung tissues of patients with lung cancer (LC, n = 37) or nonlung cancer (NLC, n = 13) and its relationships with the smoking habits and the degree of airway obstruction were investigated.
 Specimens of peripheral lung parenchyma, free of tumor tissue, were taken and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was measured in the S-12 fractions.
 Airway obstruction was assessed by flow-volume curves, and data were expressed as percentage of the predicted values.
 Cigarettes smoked were expressed as pack-years.
 The patients with LC and NLC did not differ by MDA content, age, and number of pack-years.
 On the contrary, FEF75-85 and MEF75 were significantly lower in LC than in NLC patients (p less than 0.05).
 The MDA content was inversely correlated to number of days patients had refrained from smoking (r = -0.66, p less than 0.001).
 The MDA content was higher in recent smokers (ie, people smoking during the last 30 days before surgery) than in the other patients (0.136 +/- 0.007 vs 0.116 +/- 0.007 mumol/g of tissue, p less than 0.05) and, by considering only recent smokers, MDA content was higher in LC patients (0.144 +/- 0.008 mumol/g of tissue) than in NLC patients (0.113 +/- 0.014 mmol/g tissue, p = 0.059).
 When patients were divided into "high MDA" and "low MDA" groups, MEF75 was much lower in the high MDA group (35.1 +/- 3.4 percent) than in the low MDA group (55.1 +/- 8.1 percent) (p less than 0.01).
 These results suggest the following: (1) enhanced level of prooxidant state in the lungs is associated with recent cigarette smoking; (2) LC patients may be more prone than respective NLC patients to oxidative stress; (3) MDA level and degree of small airway obstruction were associated and differed between LC and NLC patients even though these groups did not differ in the percentage of recent smokers; and (4) a common free-radical mediated pathway may be active for both LC and small airway obstruction.
