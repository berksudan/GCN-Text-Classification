Pulmonary blood volume and edema in postpneumonectomy lung growth in rats.
 After pneumonectomy in young animals, the contralateral lung undergoes compensatory growth and generally attains the same weight and air space volume as both lungs in age-matched controls.
 In this study, we determined the contribution of lung edema and increased blood volume to the weight gain in rats.
 Three weeks after pneumonectomy (n = 18) or sham pneumonectomy (n = 17), the pulmonary blood volume and the extravascular water and albumin were evaluated by use of 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes and 125I-labeled albumin.
 The air space volume, blood-free lung weights, and DNA and protein content were also compared.
 The data show that the total pulmonary blood volumes and the blood volume per gram of blood-free dry lung were similar in pneumonectomized and age-matched sham controls.
 The total extravascular albumin and the extravascular albumin per gram of blood-free dry lung were also similar as well as the extravascular lung water, wet-to-dry weight ratios, DNA and protein content, and air space volumes.
 These data indicate that the increased weight of the postpneumonectomy lung was due to cellular and stromal proliferation.
 The blood volume and interstitial fluid increased in proportion to the increase in lung parenchyma.
 Neither vascular congestion nor increased extravascular protein and water contributed to the observed weight gain.
