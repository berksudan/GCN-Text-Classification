Diagnostic value of nonfluoroscopic percutaneous lung needle aspiration in patients with pneumonia.
 In forty-one patients (mean [+/- SD] age 51 +/- 19 years; range, 11 to 88 years; seven female and 34 male) with clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia, we performed a nonfluoroscopic percutaneous lung needle (22 gauges) aspiration (PLNA) to investigate the diagnostic yield of this technique.
 All the patients were receiving antibiotics at the time of the study, and PLNA was performed either because of a lack of response to empiric antibiotic treatment or because of the severity of the pneumonia or the underlying condition of the patient.
 Eight patients were mechanically ventilated (MV) due to acute respiratory failure.
 The PLNA was performed at bedside and without fluoroscopic guidance.
 Twenty-two microorganisms were identified by means of stains and/or cultures of PLNA samples.
 Sensitivity of PLNA was 43 percent (18/41).
 We detected three false-positive cultures probably due to contamination from the skin area punctured.
 In the eight MV patients studied, the sensitivity of PLNA was 37.5 percent, and the microbiologic findings turned out to be crucial for the outcome of the patients.
 Pneumothorax developed in three patients (7 percent) after PLNA.
 None of these three patients developed a pleural infection but two of them required thoracostomy drainage.
 None of the MV patients presented complications.
 Our results showed that nonfluoroscopic PLNA is a technique with moderately good sensitivity and with a low rate of false-positive cultures (8 percent) to diagnose pulmonary infections in patients with unresponsiveness to empiric antibiotic treatment or with severe pneumonia.
 Further evaluation of its diagnostic value and complications in MV patients is needed, although our preliminary results suggest that PLNA can be an alternative technique to other methods for diagnosing pulmonary infections in patients receiving artificial ventilatory support.
