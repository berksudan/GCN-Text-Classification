Viral pneumonias. A diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.
 Viral pneumonias are both a diagnostic and a therapeutic challenge for primary care physicians.
 The illness should be suspected when an upper respiratory tract infection progresses to include dyspnea and cyanosis.
 Rapid diagnostic tests are now available to detect most of the viruses that cause pneumonias.
 Fortunately, viral pneumonias usually resolve without specific antiviral therapy; however, ribavirin is indicated for respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia in children and ganciclovir sodium (Cytovene) for cytomegalovirus pneumonia in immunocompromised patients.
 Acyclovir (Zovirax) is indicated for pneumonias due to herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus infections.
 A high index of suspicion for bacterial superinfections is essential to reduce the risk of death from this complication.
