Adult minimal change glomerulopathy with acute renal failure.
 Oliguric acute renal failure occurs in some adult patients with minimal change glomerulopathy.
 To look for clinical and pathologic factors that increase the risk for developing acute renal failure, 21 adults with minimal change glomerulopathy and a serum creatinine greater than 177 mumol/L (mean, 486 mumol/L; range, 194 to 1,344 mumol/L) (greater than 2.0 mg/dL [mean, 5.5 mg/dL; range, 2.2 to 15.2 mg/dL]) were compared with 50 adults with minimal change glomerulopathy and a serum creatinine less than 133 mumol/L (mean, 88 mumol/L; range, 53 to 124 mumol/L) (less than 1.5 mg/dL [mean, 1.0 mg/dL; range, 0.6 to 1.4 mg/dL]).
 Minimal change glomerulopathy patients with acute renal failure were older (59.5 v 40.3 years, P less than 0.001), and had higher systolic blood pressure (158 v 138 mm Hg, P = 0.001), more proteinuria (13.5 v 7.9 g/24 h, P = 0.01), and more arteriosclerosis in the renal biopsy specimen (1.7 + v 0.7 + on a scale of 0 to 4+, P = 0.005).
 Tubular epithelial simplification identical to that observed with ischemic acute renal failure (acute tubular necrosis) was observed in 71% of the patients with serum creatinine greater than 177 mumol/L (greater than 2.0 mg/dL) and 0% of those with less than 133 mumol/L (less than 1.5 mg/dL).
 All 18 patients with renal failure for whom follow-up data were available had recovery of function (mean creatinine, 539 +/- 301 mumol/L [6.1 +/- 3.4 mg/dL] at the time of biopsy and 106 +/- 27 mumol/L [1.2 +/- 0.3 mg/dL] at last follow-up), but sometimes only after weeks of dialysis support.
