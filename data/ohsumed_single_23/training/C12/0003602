The treatment of mesangial IgA nephropathy with cyclophosphamide, dipyridamole and warfarin: a two-year prospective trial.
 Of 52 patients with mesangial IgA nephropathy, 25 were allocated to treatment with cyclophosphamide (6 months), and dipyridamole and warfarin (2 years) and 27 to no treatment in a randomized prospective 2-year study.
 At entry, the treated and untreated groups of patients did not differ in mean serum creatinines, urinary protein excretions, quantitative urinary erythrocyte counts or blood pressure readings.
 At the end of the trial mean (+/- SEM) serum creatinine values had gone from 0.12 +/- 0.01 to 0.13 +/- 0.01 mmol/l (p less than 0.05) in untreated patients and from 0.10 +/- 0.01 to 0.12 +/- 0.01 mmol/l (p less than 0.05) in treated patients.
 Mean (+/- SEM) log values of urinary erythrocyte (rbc) counts had not changed significantly from 5.47 +/- 0.09 to 5.21 +/- 0.14 log rbc/ml in untreated patients, from 5.45 +/- 0.11 to 5.49 +/- 0.19 log rbc/ml in treated patients.
 However, in treated patients, mean (+/- SEM) urinary protein excretions decreased from 1.67 +/- 0.35 to 1.15 +/- 0.31 g/24 h (p less than 0.01) whereas in untreated patients urinary protein was unchanged between initial values of 1.76 +/- 0.34 and follow-up at 1.89 +/- 0.45 g/24 h.
 No significant changes in blood pressure occurred in either group.
 This study supports the observation that treatment of IgA nephropathy with cyclophosphamide, dipyridamole and warfarin is associated with a reduction of urinary protein excretion but a significant effect on preservation of renal function, at least as determined by serum creatinine values, could not be confirmed over this two-year study.
