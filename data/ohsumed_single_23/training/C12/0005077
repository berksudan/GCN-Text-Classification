Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in patients with bleeding diatheses.
 Five patients with known bleeding diatheses were treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.
 Specific therapy was administered before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy to reverse the bleeding disorder.
 After treatment each patient was monitored with serial hemoglobin determinations and renal ultrasonography.
 The course during and after lithotripsy was uneventful in all patients.
 We conclude that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is a viable option for patients with significant bleeding diatheses provided that specific therapy to reverse the coagulopathic condition is available and used before treatment.
