Effect of calcium entry blocker nitrendipine on renal function after renal vascular occlusion.
 The ability of the Ca entry blocker nitrendipine to improve postischemic renal function was studied in nine groups (n = 70) of rats.
 After anesthesia, nitrendipine was administered for 15 min through the femoral vein.
 The dose administered depended on the group.
 Group 1 (n = 7), the control, received only 0.9% NaCl, group 2 (n = 12) 0.25 mg/kg; group 3 (n = 10) 0.50 mg/kg; group 4 (n = 8) 0.75 mg/kg; group 5 (n = 6) 1.00 mg/kg; group 6 (n = 7) 1.50 mg/kg; group 7 (n = 7) 2.00 mg/kg; group 8 (n = 6) 2.50 mg/kg; and group 9 (n = 7) 3.00 mg/kg.
 After the administration of nitrendipine, the kidneys were rendered ischemic for one hour by cross-clamping the renal vessels.
 Comparison of 24-h creatinine clearances for 72 h after reversal of ischemia demonstrated that nitrendipine was capable of providing a degree of protection against renal ischemia and the protective effect was dose dependent (p less than .05).
