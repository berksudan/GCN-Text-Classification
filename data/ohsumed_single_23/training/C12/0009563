Clinical effects of a polyethylene glycol grafted cellulose membrane on thrombogenicity and biocompatibility during hemodialysis.
 The biocompatibility and thrombogenicity of polyethylene-glycol (PEG)-grafted cellulose hemodialysis (HD) membranes (PEGC) were investigated in cross-over HD of five HD patients with ordinary cellulose (OC).
 The PEGC significantly suppressed transient leukocyte and thrombocytopenia, and release of C3a, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4, in corresponding with the quantity of grafted PEG.
 HD with PEGC resulted in lower granulocyte elastase production, protein and blood cells adsorption on the membrane surface than those with OC.
 Minimum heparin in HD with PEGC was three times lower than that with OC, with the thrombin-antithrombin III complex elevation lower than that in HD with OC.
 The results indicate that the grafted PEG effectively suppresses blood and membrane interaction, thus improving biocompatibility and reducing thrombogenicity in clinical HD.
