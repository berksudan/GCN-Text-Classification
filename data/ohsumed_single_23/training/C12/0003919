Studies on requirements for trackpoints in CellSoft automated semen analysis.
 The CellSoft (CRYO Resources, Ltd., New York, NY) system for computer-assisted sperm analysis was evaluated as to the appropriate settings for trackpoints.
 Fifty-eight human spermatozoa exhibiting complex swimming modes were chosen for analysis at room temperature.
 The accumulated measures for curvilinear velocity, linearity, mean and maximum amplitude of lateral head displacement, and beat cross frequency were determined over a range of trackpoints from 2 to 37.
 Stable measures (within the 95% confidence interval at 37 frames) were observed at 4 frames for curvilinear velocity and at 20 frames for linearity.
 The corresponding figure for mean amplitude of lateral head displacement and beat cross frequency was 8 frames.
 We conclude that the frame requirements concerning measures for curvilinear velocity/linearity and mean amplitude of lateral head displacement/beat cross frequency should be 20 and 8, respectively.
 Thus, 20 consecutive frames to analyze will suffice.
