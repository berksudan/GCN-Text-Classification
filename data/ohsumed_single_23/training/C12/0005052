The management of posterior urethral valves by initial vesicostomy and delayed valve ablation.
 We managed 32 neonates and infants with temporary vesicostomy and delayed valve ablation.
 The criterion on which successful management was gauged was estimated creatinine clearance.
 Renal failure or death occurred in 30% of the patients and 7% required transplantation.
 There was no apparent difference between our patients managed initially with vesicostomy and other series managed initially with valve ablation in preventing the complications of posterior urethral valves.
