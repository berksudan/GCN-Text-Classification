Use of distal Thiersch-Duplay urethroplasty for proximal hypospadias repairs in conjunction with short island pedicle flap.
 Experience with 8 boys having proximal hypospadias with severe chordee and a foreshortened dorsal hooded foreskin is presented.
 Use of a distal Thiersch-Duplay tube was incorporated in addition to an island pedicle flap to achieve the correct meatal location on the glans.
 One boy with perineal hypospadias required both proximal and distal Thiersch tube with an island flap interposition.
 Follow-up of nine months to 3.5 years demonstrated excellent cosmetic and functional results with no recurrent chordee or urethral stenosis.
 The only fistula noted developed at the proximal Thiersch tube-island flap anastomosis in the boy with perineal hypospadias.
 Advantages of the aforementioned procedure include decreasing the risk of chordee on the basis of a foreshortened island pedicle flap, use of vascularized flaps, and completing the procedure in one stage with a satisfactory result.
