Burkitt's lymphoma of the testicle: report of 2 cases occurring in elderly patients.
 Burkitt's lymphoma is rare in patients older than 50 years and almost never presents as a testicular tumor.
 We report 2 cases of primary Burkitt's lymphoma of the testicle in men 68 and 79 years old.
 In 1 man the extragonadal tumor had a rapid and lasting response to combination chemotherapy.
 The cases are of interest for the unusual presentation of the disease and for the possibility to control Burkitt's lymphoma in older patients without undue toxicity.
 The management of testicular lymphoma requires radical orchiectomy and prophylactic irradiation of the contralateral testis.
 Chemotherapy is indicated for advanced disease and may prevent relapses in patients with early disease.
 The role of central nervous system prophylaxis is controversial.
