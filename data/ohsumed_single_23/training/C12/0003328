Treatment of outflow tract obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia with the pollen extract, cernilton. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
 Whilst prostatectomy remains the "gold standard" for the treatment of outflow tract obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, medical treatment--if only for symptomatic relief--appears to be an attractive alternative.
 Most of the pharmacological agents in use block the hormonal or the sympathetic neurological pathways that influence prostate growth and function.
 All of these drugs are known to have side effects.
 Sixty patients with outflow obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were entered into a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of a 6-month course of the pollen extract, Cernilton.
 There was a statistically significant subjective improvement with Cernilton (69% of the patients) compared with placebo (30%).
 There was a significant decrease in residual urine in the patients treated with Cernilton and in the antero-posterior (A-P) diameter of the prostate on ultrasound.
 However, differences in respect of flow rate and voided volume were not statistically significant.
 It is concluded that Cernilton has a beneficial effect in BPH and may have a place in the treatment of patients with mild or moderate symptoms of outflow obstruction.
