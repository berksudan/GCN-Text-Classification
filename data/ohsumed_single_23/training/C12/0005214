Toxicity comparison of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC) in radical cystectomy patients.
 A reduction in the toxicity of M-VAC chemotherapy has been postulated for patients who receive these drugs prior to radical cystectomy for muscle invasive bladder carcinoma.
 A review of the toxicity and patient dropout rates from a group of 9 patients who received neoadjuvant M-VAC was little different from 9 patients who were treated with M-VAC after radical cystectomy.
 This similarity suggests that preoperative M-VAC should not be favored on the basis of reduced patient morbidity.
