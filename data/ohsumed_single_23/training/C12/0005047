Mohan's urethral valvotome: a new instrument.
 Electrothermic fulguration of posterior urethral valves with a resectoscope is difficult in newborns, especially in small for gestation date and premature newborns because of a small caliber urethra.
 This difficulty has prompted the innovation of the valvotome described.
 The outer diameter of the valvotome is 3 mm.
 and it can be easily introduced without stretching the urethra.
 This instrument has been used successfully in 8 patients to date.
 Patient age ranged from 3 days to 3 1/2 years with varying degrees of hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
 All patients have a good urinary stream with regression of the hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
