A glance at the urodynamic database.
 Three hundred sixty-four patients with urinary incontinence as their presenting complaint were evaluated in the urogynecology laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York.
 Of them, 226 (62%) were found to have genuine stress urinary incontinence (GSI).
 This subset of demonstrably incontinent patients was characterized as to symptoms of stress and urge incontinence, incidence of nulliparity, occurrence of incontinence during intercourse and influence of weight on bladder pressure.
 Using clusters of symptoms did not accurately distinguish GSI from the other types of urinary incontinence.
 Four percent of the GSI patients were nulliparous.
 All had a reasonable explanation for incontinence other than anatomic relaxation.
 Twenty-three percent of the 154 sexually active GSI patients acknowledged having incontinence with intercourse.
 None of the anatomic and urodynamic parameters evaluated distinguished that group from their GSI counterparts who did not lose urine with intercourse.
 Increasing weight, expressed as the body mass index, correlated with an increase in the vesical pressure in the supine and standing positions.
