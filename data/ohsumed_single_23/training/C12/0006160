In treating impotence, urology and sex therapy are complementary.
 Urologists and mental health professionals are neither competitors nor adversaries.
 The principles of sex therapy represent a thoughtful and sensitive way to approach patients with almost any clinical problem so that they are more comfortable with the recommended tests or treatments.
 Sex therapy may be very helpful as an adjunct in treating "organic" as well as primarily emotional erectile dysfunction.
 We believe that with information we can help build a bridge between urologists and mental health professionals.
