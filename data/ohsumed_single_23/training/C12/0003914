Psychological assessment and follow-up after in vitro fertilization: assessing the impact of failure.
 The present study was conducted to assess the immediate psychological impact of failed in vitro fertilization (IVF).
 Emotional status and marital functioning were also examined pre-IVF, and both demographic information and psychological test scores were evaluated as predictors of reaction to treatment failure.
 After a failed first cycle, both males and females showed significant increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms.
 Although group means were not clinically elevated and most participants were coping adequately, the prevalence of both mild and moderate depression increased substantially, particularly among women.
 In addition, women without children were a subgroup particularly vulnerable to the stress of failure.
 Predisposition towards anxiety, pre-IVF depressive symptoms, and fertility history were the most important predictors of emotional response.
 Treatment implications of these findings were discussed.
