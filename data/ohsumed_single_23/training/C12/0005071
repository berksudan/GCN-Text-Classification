Hyperfiltration-induced renal injury in normal man: myth or reality.
 Current knowledge fails to support the notion that adaptive hyperfiltration of the remnant kidney after donor nephrectomy is deleterious.
 Rather than being maladaptive, hyperfiltration appropriately compensates for the loss of functional renal mass.
 Accordingly, most kidney donors can be expected to maintain a stable level of renal function without proteinuria or hypertension.
 Essential to this is proper selection of donors for nephrectomy and exclusion of high risk potential donors, bearing in mind the fact that apparently healthy, asymptomatic relatives of end stage renal disease patients are prone to the same disease processes that inflict the general population and have a higher risk of underlying renal disease.
