Transrectal sonographic cystourethrography: studies in stress urinary incontinence.
 Transrectal ultrasonic sagittal transducer is an excellent modality to image the bladder and urethra in dynamic change.
 In female patients, we found it is also helpful for the diagnosis of urinary stress incontinence.
 The posterior urethrovesical (PUV) angle is measured with the transrectal sonoprobe under strain and non-strain conditions.
 We compared the results of sonographic cystourethrogram with the radiographic chain cystourethrogram.
 The sonographic cystourethrography is superior to the radiography.
 The former may estimate the PUV angle accurately and differentiate between the patients with and without stress urinary incontinence.
 Furthermore, we also use the transrectal sagittal probe intraoperatively to adjust the suspension force as well as PUV angle in patients who underwent vesical neck suspension for stress urinary incontinence (SUI).
