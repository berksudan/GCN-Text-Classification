Nephrotoxicity associated with concomitant ACE inhibitor and NSAID therapy.
 Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be nephrotoxic and may synergistically compromise renal function.
 A computer-assisted study was done to asses the prevalence of compromised renal function and the clinical importance of this drug interaction.
 A search of the records of all patients seen in the University of Nebraska Medical Center Internal Medicine Clinic was conducted to identify cases involving renal insufficiency, therapy with ACE inhibitors, or therapy with NSAIDs.
 Records of cases meeting these criteria were reviewed for clinical correlation and revealed 2278 patients treated with NSAIDs, 328 with ACE inhibitors, and 162 with both.
 No nephrotoxicity was found in conjunction with monotherapy, but three cases of reversible renal failure were found in conjunction with combination therapy.
 Significant nephrotoxicity during the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs is not uncommon, and attention should be drawn to this potentially important interaction.
