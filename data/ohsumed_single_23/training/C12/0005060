Polyarteritis nodosa masquerading as a primary testicular neoplasm: a case report and review of the literature.
 We report a case of polyarteritis nodosa presenting as a mass in the testis mimicking a neoplasm.
 The diagnosis was confirmed by radical orchiectomy.
 This is an unusual presentation of this systemic disease.
 We discuss the physical findings, ultrasonographic features and pathological findings, as well as review the literature for previous similar cases.
