Magnetic resonance imaging of cystic, partially differentiated nephroblastoma.
 The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance of a cystic, partially differentiated nephroblastoma is described, together with pathologic correlation.
 The difficulty in reaching a correct preoperative diagnosis even with multimodal imaging techniques is emphasized.
 MRI is an adjunct to ultrasonography and may be superior to computerized tomography (CT) scan in the evaluation of a child with multiloculated cystic renal mass.
