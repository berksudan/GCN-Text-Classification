Flutamide in hormone-resistant prostatic cancer.
 Flutamide (250 mg.
 orally 3 times daily) yielded a subjective response in 5 of 25 fully evaluable patients with hormone-resistant prostatic cancer.
 Four additional patients had early progression.
 A 40% or greater decrease in the pre-treatment prostate specific antigen level was observed in 7 of 24 patients and this finding was correlated with improved survival.
 Toxicity was mainly gastrointestinal and resulted in permanent discontinuation of flutamide in 5 patients.
 Flutamide or similar antiandrogens may have a role in the management of hormone-resistant prostatic cancer when relief of subjective symptoms should be an important treatment goal together with improvement of survival.
 However, before the drug should be used routinely in the management of hormone-resistant prostatic cancer phase 3 studies must confirm its effectiveness, especially in comparison to less expensive drugs.
