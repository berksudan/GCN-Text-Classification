Non-heparin hemodialysis with oral administration of newly developed antiplatelet agent.
 Non-heparin hemodialysis (HD) was successfully done in anuric dogs with the oral administration of a newly developed antiplatelet agent, 4-cyano-5,5-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-pentenoic acid, (E5510, Eisai Pharmaceutical Co., Japan).
 In the current study, the antithrombotic effect of E5510 during HD was investigated.
 Eleven mongrel dogs with bilateral ureteral ligation were given 0.1 mg/kg of E5510 orally 1 hr before undergoing 4 hr HD using hollow fiber dialyzers, (PMMA 5, regenerated cellulose 6) without heparin and under general anesthesia.
 Blood samples were taken before the administration of E5510 and before and 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after starting HD; blood counts, hematocrits, blood chemistries, and plasma thromboxane levels (TxB2) were examined.
 Platelet aggregation, activated clotting times (ACT), and activated partial thrombin times (APTT) were also measured, and sequential plasma E5510 concentrations were determined.
 In 10 of 11 anuric dogs, non-heparin HD was successfully done with minimal clotting in the dialyzer and drip chambers.
 The maximum aggregation rate was depressed to less than 20% of the initial value throughout HD.
 Plasma TxB2 concentration was depressed, and ACT and APTT were mildly, but not significantly prolonged.
 Neither hemorrhagic complications nor other side effects of E5510 were observed.
