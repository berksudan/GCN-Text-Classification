Confronting cisternae presenting as intracytoplasmic inclusions in monocytes.
 Small gray-blue intracytoplasmic inclusions were noted in the peripheral monocytes and neutrophils from a patient with renal failure.
 Ultrastructural analysis revealed confronting cisternae within the cytoplasm.
 The authors submit a case report to introduce a previously undescribed morphologic feature of leukocytes that may be mistaken at the light microscopic level for Dohle bodies or other inclusions.
