Is preliminary binephrectomy necessary in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease undergoing renal transplantation?
 Patients with end-stage chronic renal failure due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who underwent renal transplantation with or without preliminary binephrectomy were retrospectively studied to determine the effect of binephrectomy on outcome.
 Nineteen patients were identified.
 Thirteen patients had no surgery prior to transplantation and six underwent preliminary binephrectomy.
 One patient died as a result of the nephrectomy.
 Twenty-one renal allografts were performed on 18 patients of whom seven have died of sepsis; 10 have functioning grafts and one has returned to dialysis.
 Patients not undergoing preliminary binephrectomy had a statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increase in mortality and morbidity due to septic complications related to polycystic kidney disease.
 Indications for bilateral nephrectomy should be reconsidered.
