Basic evaluation of female urinary incontinence.
 Urinary incontinence is a common disorder that is frequently underreported because of its social implications.
 Although several types of urinary incontinence are recognized, they can be generally classified as failure of the bladder to store or failure of the urethral mechanism.
 A systematic approach for the evaluation of incontinence that includes history, physical examination, basic laboratory tests, and often urodynamic evaluation, offers the most comprehensive assessment of the etiology of incontinence.
