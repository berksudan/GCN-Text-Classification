Difference in beta 2-microglobulin removal between cellulosic and synthetic polymer membrane dialyzers.
 Several kinds of dialyzers, with highly permeable membranes (HPM), have been designed to specifically remove beta 2-microglobulin (BMG).
 To clarify their solute transport characteristics, nine types of HPM dialyzers were evaluated during in vivo and in vitro studies using human plasma and aqueous solutions.
 No BMG membrane adsorption and/or plugging was seen with cellulosic membrane dialyzers during in vitro experiments using human plasma.
 On the other hand, all synthetic polymer membrane dialyzers had adsorptive properties, and in a dialyzer with a polymethylmethacrylate membrane, a large amount of BMG was removed by adsorption alone.
 Dialyzers with cellulose triacetate and polyacrylonitril membranes showed higher values of BMG diffusive dialysance (greater than 20 ml/min) and sieving coefficient (greater than 0.9).
 From in vitro experiments using an aqueous solution containing several solutes with relatively small or middle molecular weights, all HPM dialyzers had a higher overall mass transfer coefficient than any conventional membrane dialyzer.
