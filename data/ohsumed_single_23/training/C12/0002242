Treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis by oral androgen mesterolone. A clinical and cystometric study.
 A double-blind clinical study of 30 boys, six to ten years of age, with primary nocturnal enuresis was undertaken to assess the role of androgens in treating enuresis.
 The oral synthetic androgen mesterolone was selected because of its minimal potential toxic effects.
 Twenty boys were treated with mesterolone and 10 received placebo.
 Fourteen boys (70%) became dry during treatment (20 mg daily for 14 days), and 5 (25%) remained dry for a follow-up period of four months.
 Increased cystometric bladder capacity and disappearance of uninhibited detrusor contractions were noticed in a significant number of cases after treatment.
 No side effects were recorded.
 Mesterolone has probably modulated the autonomic innervation of the vesical musculature with correction of the defective neural mechanism which is believed to be implicated in the pathogenesis of nocturnal enuresis.
