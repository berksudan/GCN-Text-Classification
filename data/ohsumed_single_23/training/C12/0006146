Whole bladder photodynamic therapy: critical review of present-day technology and rationale for development of intravesical laser catheter and monitoring system.
 Present-day whole bladder photodynamic therapy (WBPDT) is cumbersome and time consuming because cystoscopic and ultrasonic manipulations are necessary to position the light emitter within the bladder.
 More important, WBPDT is inherently unsafe and often ineffective since neither uniform photoirradiation nor accurate light dosimetry can be achieved with the techniques employed to photoirradiate the bladder wall.
 The intravesical laser catheter (IVLC) eliminates the need for cystoscopy and ultrasonography because passage of the treatment fiber into the catheter's central lumen automatically positions its light-diffusing tip within the center of the bladder.
 Use of the IVLC delivery system also assures accurate photoirradiation of the bladder wall since inflation of the catheter's balloon transforms the asymmetric bladder into a sphere of known diameter.
 The light sensor incorporated in the balloon wall provides a method to monitor light fluence and measure total light dose.
 When provided the parameters of bladder volume, laser energy output, and desired light dose, the computerized control system calculates treatment time and automatically adjusts the period of photoirradiation to compensate for variations in laser light production, energy losses during transmission, and for variations in light intensity resulting from the integrating sphere effect of the bladder wall.
 This delivery system also increases the safety of WBPDT since the monitor automatically discontinues treatment if any unsafe situation, with respect to light fluence, develops during photoirradiation.
