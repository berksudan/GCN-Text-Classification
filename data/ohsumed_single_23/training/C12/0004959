Stress incontinence and low urethral closure pressure. Correlation of preoperative urethral hypermobility with successful suburethral sling procedures.
 Forty-eight women with genuine stress incontinence and low urethral closure pressure were treated with a suburethral sling procedure using polytetrafluoroethylene.
 All patients underwent a preoperative clinical evaluation and multichannel urodynamic testing.
 The clinical examination included a "Q-tip" test to determine the presence or absence of urethral hypermobility.
 Urethral hypermobility was defined as a maximal angle change of greater than or equal to 30 degrees from the horizontal, measured during straining or coughing in the lithotomy position.
 Thirty-four patients underwent repeat multichannel urodynamic testing three months postoperatively to determine the objective surgical success.
 Ninety-three percent of patients (27/29) with a positive preoperative Q-tip test were cured.
 Of patients with a negative preoperative Q-tip test, only 20% (1/5) were cured.
 Preoperative urethral hypermobility was a good prognostic indicator of operative success when a suburethral sling procedure was used to treat genuine stress incontinence and low urethral closure pressure.
