A reverse (antibody capture) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of antisperm antibodies in sera and genital tract secretions.
 A reverse (antibody capture) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of antisperm antibodies has been developed.
 The assay enables detection of immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG, IgA, or IgM, IgG, and IgA--antisperm antibodies in serum, cervical mucus, and seminal plasma samples.
 The reverse ELISA is more specific and sensitive than conventional ELISA in detecting human antisperm antibodies of different isotypes.
 Using this assay, statistically significant differences in levels of antibodies between infertile and fertile individuals were demonstrated in sera and in genital tract secretions.
 Studies with 143 infertile couples revealed that the presence of antibodies in sera was not necessarily reflected in individual's genital tract secretion and vice versa.
 These data emphasize the importance of detecting antisperm antibodies in sera as well as in genital tract secretions for correct evaluation of sperm immunity.
