Sedoanalgesia in urology: a safe, cost-effective alternative to general anaesthesia. A review of 1020 cases.
 Sedoanalgesia is a technique developed to provide safe and satisfactory operating conditions for a wide range of patients independent of age and overall level of fitness (although its use in children remains to be established).
 It is suitable for both endoscopic and open procedures, day-cases and in-patients.
 When used in day-case surgery it significantly improves overall efficiency.
 It is recognised that day-case surgery is an important and cost-effective element in surgical care.
 With increasing restraints being imposed upon hospital finances, patient beds and staffing levels, any strategies designed to improve efficiency in this sphere of surgical activity are to be welcomed.
 That 93% of patients prefer sedoanalgesia to conventional general anaesthesia attests to its high degree of acceptability.
 The technique of sedoanalgesia, its applications and potential impact for urology are detailed.
