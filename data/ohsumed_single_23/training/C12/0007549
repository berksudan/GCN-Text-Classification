Sodium loading treatment for amphotericin B-induced nephrotoxicity.
 The increased frequency and duration of antifungal treatment with amphotericin B in immunocompromised patients has stimulated a great deal of research into the mechanisms of its nephrotoxic effects and treatment modalities designed to attenuate these effects.
 A review of amphotericin B-induced nephrotoxicity, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and the role of salt loading as a means of minimizing renal impairment are described.
 Both animal and human studies regarding the efficacy of sodium loading are presented as well as a case report describing the use of salt supplementation over a prolonged course of therapy.
