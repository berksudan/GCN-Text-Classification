Hypophosphatemia in infants on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
 Three infants with irreversible renal failure and treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) developed hypophosphatemia.
 In one of them rachitic lesions were observed on X-ray and bone biopsy showed osteomalacic osteodystrophy.
 Different mechanisms may have been at the origin of the hypophosphatemia: high doses of phosphate binders, low phosphorus intake, phosphate loss with the dialysate and possibly nutritional repletion.
 Dietary phosphorus restriction and use of phosphate binders should be applied with caution and serum phosphate should be monitored regularly in infants treated with CAPD.
