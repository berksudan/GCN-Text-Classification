Prolonged neuromuscular blockade with vecuronium in a neonate with renal failure.
 An 11-day-old neonate with renal failure caused by dysplastic kidneys was anaesthetised with thiopentone, vecuronium, nitrous oxide and oxygen, for insertion of a long-term peritoneal dialysis catheter.
 Complete neuromuscular block of 210 minutes' duration ensued after the initial dose of vecuronium (97 micrograms/kg).
 Partial block persisted for a further 30 minutes.
 The prolonged neuromuscular block in this case may have been because of proportionately greater dependence on renal clearance of vecuronium in neonates.
