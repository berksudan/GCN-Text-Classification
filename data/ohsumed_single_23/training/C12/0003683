Validity of creatinine clearance estimates in the assessment of renal function.
 In clinical practice, estimations of renal function are commonly used to calculate the appropriate dose for drugs that are renally cleared.
 Continuous-infusion inulin clearance (CLIN), 4-hour creatinine clearance (CLCR,m), and 24-hour creatinine clearance (CLCR,a) were measured in 109 subjects (86 men and 23 women) with varying degrees of stable renal function (CLIN, 6 to 209 ml/min) and compared with CLCR values as predicted by five equations on the basis of plasma creatinine concentrations, age, weight, and/or height.
 The CLCR,m was positively correlated with CLIN (r = 0.92; p less than 0.0001) but exceeded CLIN by 15% between the range of 30 and 209 ml/min (CLIN).
 Similarly, CLCR,a correlated well with both CLCR,m (r = 0.84; p less than 0.0005) and CLIN (r = 0.84; p less than 0.0001).
 The relative role of tubular secretion in the overall clearance of creatinine increased with declining CLIN and exceeded 40% when CLIN was below 30 ml/min.
 CLCR estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault and Mawer methods did not significantly differ from either CLCR,m or CLCR,m, whereas the other equations generally underestimated CLCR.
 Among the numerous mathematical equations, CLCR as estimated by the method proposed either by Mawer or Cockcroft and Gault was the best predictor of CLIN (CLIN = 1.05CLRCR - 18.38 or CLIN = 1.12CLCR - 20.60, respectively; r = 0.81; p less than 0.0001).
 The present data support the use of estimator equations proposed by Cockcroft and Gault or Mawer for rapid estimation of renal function in the clinical setting.
