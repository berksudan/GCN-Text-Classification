Intrarenal de novo production of angiotensin I in subjects with renal artery stenosis.
 To estimate the renal extraction and de novo production of angiotensin I and to assess the contribution of blood-borne renin to renal angiotensin I production, the aortic and renal venous plasma levels of renin and intact [125I]angiotensin I and endogenous angiotensin I during continuous systemic intravenous infusion of monoiodinated [125I]angiotensin I were measured in subjects with unilateral renal artery stenosis (n = 8) who were treated with captopril (50 mg b.i.d.).
 Results demonstrated that 80% of angiotensin I delivered by the renal artery was extracted both by the affected and the unaffected kidney and that on both sides a major part of angiotensin I in the renal vein was derived from intrarenal de novo production.
 Production of plasma angiotensin I was in excess over extraction (p less than 0.01) on the affected side, whereas extraction was in excess over production (p less than 0.01) on the contralateral side.
 The plasma level of de novo intrarenally produced angiotensin I in the renal vein was seven times higher on the affected side than the contralateral side.
 This difference was by far too big to be explained by a difference in the transit time of blood between the two kidneys, by an augmented production of angiotensin I in the circulating blood passing through the affected kidney due to the higher level of venous plasma renin activity in that kidney, or by the combination of both.
