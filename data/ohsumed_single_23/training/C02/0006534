HIV seroconversion in two homosexual men after receptive oral intercourse with ejaculation: implications for counseling concerning safe sexual practices.
 Seroconversion for HIV antibody occurred in two homosexual men who reported no anal intercourse for greater than or equal to 5 years and multiple episodes of receptive oral intercourse with ejaculation.
 Neither man reported intravenous drug use or receipt of blood products.
 The last antibody-negative specimen was also negative by the polymerase chain reaction and p24 antigen assays.
 All sexually active persons should be clearly counselled that receptive oral intercourse with ejaculation carries a potential risk of HIV transmission.
