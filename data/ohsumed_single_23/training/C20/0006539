Evaluation of the efficacy and cost effectiveness of health education methods to increase medication adherence among adults with asthma.
 We randomized 135 adult asthma patients to a control group, and 132 patients to an experimental group which received a special health education intervention.
 Four adherence measures were documented at baseline and 12-month follow-up: correct inhaler use, inhaler adherence, medication adherence, and total adherence rating.
 Costs to routinely deliver the intervention were $32.03/patient.
 Experimental group patients exhibited a significantly higher level of improvement in adherence (44 percent) than control group patients (2 percent).
