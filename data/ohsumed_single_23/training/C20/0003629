Anaphylactic shock associated with chymopapain skin test. A case report and review of the literature.
 The allergic response to chymopapain intradiscal therapy has been well documented.
 The most serious of these reactions is anaphylactic shock, which may result in death.
 Various screening methods, including skin tests, have been proposed to identify susceptible patients.
 Anaphylactic shock occurred in a 40-year-old woman from application of the screening skin test.
 Appropriate therapeutic intervention should be readily accessible when this test is performed.
