AIDS-related knowledge, sexual behavior, and condom use among men and women in Kinshasa, Zaire.
 This study was conducted in 1988 among a random sample of 6,625 men and women of reproductive age in all 24 administrative zones of Kinshasa, the capital city of Zaire, to determine existing levels of knowledge regarding AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), sexual behavior, knowledge and use of condoms in marital and extramarital relations; perceived risk of AIDS, and attitudes toward testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
 Awareness of AIDS is almost universal, and the vast majority know the four main modes of transmission.
 Almost half believed in transmission by mosquitoes and in a vaccine or cure for AIDS.
 The majority of male respondents knew of condoms, but negative attitudes toward condom use are widespread, and few respondents perceived them to play a central role in combatting AIDS.
