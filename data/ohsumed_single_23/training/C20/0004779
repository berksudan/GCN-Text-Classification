Serial studies of evoked potentials and circulating lymphocyte subsets for multiple sclerosis: attempts to monitor progress.
 A concurrent change in evoked potential measurements and quantitation of circulating T-suppressor (CD8) lymphocyte subpopulations might indicate increased subclinical disease activity.
 Eight untreated patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis were monitored monthly for changes in the numbers of cells positive for CD8 markers, and hence in the ratio of CD4: CD8 positive cells.
 Such changes were found not to be associated with changes in evoked potentials or clinical status.
