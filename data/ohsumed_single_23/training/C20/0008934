Monoclonal antibodies to immunogenic lymphoma cell variants displaying impaired neoplastic properties: characterization and applications.
 Immunogenic, nontumorigenic cell variants derived from the highly tumorigenic mouse lymphoma cell line S-49 were used to raise monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in syngeneic BALB/c mice.
 MAbs of the following specifications were derived: (a) MAbs that interacted preferentially with the immunogenic variants, (b) MAbs that interacted with both immunogenic variants and parental tumorigenic cells, and (c) a MAb that interacted with both immunogenic and tumorigenic S-49 cells and the normal BALB/c splenocytes.
 Six MAbs raised in this way were found to recognize at least five different cell-surface epitopes.
 Functional analysis of the different MAbs suggested their potential usefulness in passive immunization against parental tumorigenic cells as well as in enrichment of immunogenic cells from a mixed population containing a preponderance of tumorigenic cells.
