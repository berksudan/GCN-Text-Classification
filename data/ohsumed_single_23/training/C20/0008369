Biology of retroviruses. Detection, molecular biology, and treatment of retroviral infection.
 Although human retrovirology can trace its roots to the early part of this century, it has been within the last decade that the field has seen its greatest advances, including the description of the first human retroviruses, HTLV-I, and the subsequent discovery of HTLV-II and the AIDS retroviruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2.
 The growth this field has undergone in recent years would not have been possible had it not been for key advances in the fields of cell biology, immunology, biochemistry, and molecular biology.
 Nowhere has this been more evident than in the description of HIV as the etiologic agent of AIDS.
 In the relatively short time since the disease was initially described, the agent responsible has been isolated, much of its complex biology has been defined, and a drug that helps combat it has been licensed for use.
 The rapidity with which these events have transpired is largely unprecedented.
 There remain many unanswered questions regarding HIV and AIDS, and there still is no effective vaccine or cure.
 Significant questions regarding the immune response to HIV and the HIV response to immune or chemotherapeutic challenge, the establishment and maintenance of HIV latency, and the all-important mechanisms of HIV cytopathicity remain unanswered.
 It is clear that HIV offers no easy answers, and that significant work remains to be done before death from AIDS can be halted.
