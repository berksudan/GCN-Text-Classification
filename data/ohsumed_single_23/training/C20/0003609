SLE nephritis: an ultrastructural immunogold study to evaluate the relationship between immune complexes and the basement membrane components type IV collagen, fibronectin and heparan sulphate proteoglycans.
 The nature of immune complexes and their relationship to the normal glomerular basement membrane (GBM) components type IV collagen, fibronectin, and heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) have been examined in the glomeruli of 7 cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) glomerulonephritis using an ultrastructural immunogold technique.
 In paraformaldehyde-fixed, Lowicryl resin-embedded tissue, the electron-dense deposits contained IgG, IgM, IgA, and C3 whether they were subepithelial, intramembranous, subendothelial, or mesangial and there was no particular relationship between the class of immunoglobulin and site of immune complex localization within the glomerulus.
 The normal GBM components type IV collagen, fibronectin, and HSPG were found within all the glomeruli, but did not have the same distribution.
 Type IV collagen and fibronectin were found predominantly on the inner aspect of the GBM and diffusely throughout the more central regions of the mesangial matrix.
 By contrast the HSPG was seen mainly on the outer aspect of the GBM and at the periphery of the mesangial matrix.
 In none of the cases were GBM antigens localized within the electron-dense deposits, results which suggest that autoantibodies to these GBM components may not play a role in the development of the glomerulonephritis.
