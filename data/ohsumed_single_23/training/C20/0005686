Cytomegalovirus. An update for primary care physicians.
 Cytomegalovirus infection is spread in various ways--from mother to fetus or baby, from small children in day-care centers to caregivers and parents, by blood transfusions, by sexual contact.
 Although the illness is usually inconsequential, congenital infection can have severe consequences, including mental retardation and hearing loss.
 Dr Bean describes the different aspects of this virus and discusses a promising vaccine that may prevent congenital disease.
