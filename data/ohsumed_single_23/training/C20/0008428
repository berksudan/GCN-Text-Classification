Putative tyrosine kinases expressed in K-562 human leukemia cells.
 Tyrosine phosphorylation is important in the transmission of growth and differentiation signals; known tyrosine kinases include several oncoproteins and growth factor receptors.
 Interestingly, some differentiated cell types, such as erythrocytes and platelets contain high amounts of phosphotyrosine.
 We analyzed tyrosine kinases expressed in the K-562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, which has a bipotential erythroid and megakaryoblastoid differentiation capacity.
 Analysis of 359 polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA clones led to the identification of 14 different tyrosine kinase-related sequences (JTK1-14).
 Two of the clones (JTK2 and JTK4) represent unusual members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene family, and the clones JTK5, JTK11, and JTK14 may also belong to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases but lack a close relationship to any known tyrosine kinase.
 Each of these different genes has its own characteristic expression pattern in K-562 cells and several other human tumor cell lines.
 In addition, the JTK11 and JTK14 mRNAs are induced during the megakaryoblastoid differentiation of K-562 cells.
 These tyrosine kinases may have a role in the differentiation of megakaryoblasts or in the physiology of platelets.
