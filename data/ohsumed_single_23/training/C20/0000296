Genetic aspects of juvenile chronic arthritis.
 Immunogenetic studies in the past decade have confirmed the theory of an association between one's immunogenetic background and the manifestation of several forms of juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA), in particular pauciarticular-onset JCA.
 Considerable work has been done at the serologic level to demonstrate disease association with the major histocompatibility Class II antigens in pauciarticular-onset JCA.
 The polygenic nature of JCA is best illustrated by the findings in this particularly well-defined clinical subgroup.
 Evidence is now emerging that analysis of the DNA sequence, the derived protein sequence, and the structure of Class II molecules will yield significant insight into the genetic predisposition to JCA.
