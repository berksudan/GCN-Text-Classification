Normal responsiveness of superficial hand veins to alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimuli in allergic asthma: effects of terbutaline and prednisolone on beta-adrenergic responsiveness.
 Impaired function of the adrenergic-receptor system has been postulated to contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma.
 Using the dorsal hand-vein compliance technique, we compared the changes in diameter of superficial hand veins in response to phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, and to isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, in 14 untreated patients with allergic asthma and in 16 nonatopic control subjects.
 There were no significant differences in the median effective dose of phenylephrine that produced 50% of maximal venoconstriction (ED50) or in the maximal response (Emax) between the two groups.
 Bronchial hyperreactivity (assessed by methacholine-challenge tests) in the patients with asthma was uncorrelated with the ED50 or Emax of isoproterenol.
 These results demonstrate no evidence for a generalized change in alpha- or beta-adrenergic responsiveness on smooth muscle cells in asthma.
 Hand-vein responsiveness to isoproterenol was unchanged after treatment for 7 days with oral terbutaline (5 mg three times per day).
 Thus, unlike leukocytes, smooth muscle appears not readily susceptible to beta-adrenoceptor desensitization in vivo.
 Local infusions of prednisolone or dexamethasone during 2 hours and systemic administration of dexamethasone (24 hours) caused a significant fall in the Emax for isoproterenol.
 The mechanism of attenuation of beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness by corticosteroids remains to be determined.
