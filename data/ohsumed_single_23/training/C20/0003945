Multiple alterations in insulin responses to glucose in islets from 48-h glucose-infused nondiabetic rats.
 To examine the biochemical mechanisms by which hyperglycemia produces insulin secretory abnormalities, we studied isolated islets from control rats and rats infused for 48 h with a 50% glucose solution.
 To preserve the effects of in vivo hyperglycemia during in vitro handling for islet isolation, our standard isolation procedure utilized buffers containing 16.8 mM glucose.
 Islets from infused rats released similar amounts of insulin in low or high glucose during first incubations at 37 degrees C (92.4 +/- 7.0 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 2.8 mM, 84.4 +/- 4.1 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 16.8 mM) in contrast with control (uninfused) islets (18.6 +/- 2.8 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 2.8 mM and 109.8 +/- 8.0 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 16.8 mM glucose) (P less than 0.01).
 Secretion by islets of glucose-infused rats was lower during 60-min second incubations at 28 mM glucose than in first incubations of the same islets in low glucose (P less than 0.01).
 This phenomenon is comparable to the paradoxical hypersecretion observed during the first 10-15 min of exposure of glucose-infused pancreas to low-glucose perfusions.
 Paradoxical secretion in low glucose waned rapidly, so that during second incubations at 37 degrees C, little immunoreactive insulin release occurred at 2.8 mM glucose, despite the persistence of two additional lesions.
 The glucose-insulin dose-response curves in second incubations showed a leftward shift for glucose-infused islets, with two- to threefold higher secretion at 5.6-8.4 mM glucose than control islets.
 This is termed sensitization to glucose.
