Late pulmonary allergic responses in actively but not passively IgE-sensitized rats.
 Previous studies suggested that although rats that were passively sensitized [monoclonal murine immunoglobulin E (IgE)] would respond to pulmonary antigen challenge with an immediate increase in resistance, they exhibited no late increases in resistance, unlike late changes in rats actively sensitized to preferentially produce IgE antibody.
 We hypothesized that passively sensitized rats also would not develop antigen-induced pulmonary inflammation.
 In a blinded protocol we compared immediate responses and pulmonary resistance and inflammation at 8, 19 and 24 h after challenge with placebo antigen, with dinitrophenol-bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) to elicit a passively sensitized response, or with ovalbumin (OA) to elicit an actively sensitized response.
 Despite similar immediate responses to OA and DNP-BSA, only the rats challenged with OA had marked inflammatory changes and a significant incidence of late elevations in resistance.
 Inflammation scores and lung resistance were significantly correlated only in the OA group.
 We also observed that anesthesia with fentanyl/droperidol significantly attenuated the immediate but not the late responses to antigen challenge, compared with rats anesthetized with ketamine.
 We conclude that IgE-mediated immediate responses to pulmonary antigen challenge are insufficient, and may be unnecessary, to initiate antigen-induced late inflammatory changes.
