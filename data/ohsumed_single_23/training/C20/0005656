Pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: an unusually high incidence of twinning.
 Surveillance data on incidence of twins among reported cases of pediatric AIDS in New York City are presented.
 Most pairs are concordant for HIV infection.
 Three discordant pairs have been described elsewhere.
 Possible reasons for the association are discussed, including the most likely explanation that twins show symptoms early and are overrepresented in the early years of surveillance of pediatric AIDS.
