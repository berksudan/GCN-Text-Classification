Effect of digitalis on clinical symptoms and conduction variables in patients with multiple sclerosis.
 Digitalis has been shown to reverse conduction block in demyelinated nerve fibers in experimental animals.
 In the search for a symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis, digoxin (0.02 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given intravenously to 7 patients with probable or clinically definite multiple sclerosis.
 All of these patients had temperature-dependent symptoms.
 In 3 patients, improvement of clinical deficits was observed concurrent with significant changes in evoked potential findings.
 Digitalis derivatives may be useful in ameliorating symptoms in selected patients with multiple sclerosis.
