Immunoblot analysis of sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: correlation with disease activity.
 Immunoblot analysis was used to evaluate the IgG, IgE, and IgA responses to Aspergillus fumigatus antigen with the sera of five patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) before, during, and after suspected exacerbation of their disease.
 The results revealed a heterogenous antibody response, unique for each patient, to specific Aspergillus fumigatus antigens that correlated with the molecular weights of previously well-characterized antigens of importance in the immunopathogenesis of ABPA.
 A rating scale was devised for measuring band intensity that allowed the patient's antibody responses to be reproducibly semiquantitated.
 Immunoblot analysis demonstrated qualitative and semiquantitative information that is not available with other in vitro assays used in the study of patients with ABPA, such as ELISA.
 These initial results emphasize the need for additional evaluation of this technique to assess its potential clinical application in this disease.
