Transfusion-induced graft-versus-host disease in patients with malignant lymphoma. A case report and review of the literature.
 A case of transfusion-induced graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurring in a 31-year-old female with Hodgkin's disease in complete remission is reported.
 Clinical features are similar to 19 other reported cases of transfusion-induced GVHD associated with malignant lymphoma.
 The lack of relationship with underlying histology or disease stage and the nearly uniformly fatal outcome underscores the importance of prophylactic irradiation of blood products given to patients with malignant lymphoma undergoing therapy.
