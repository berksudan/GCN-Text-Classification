Cytotoxic activity against HIV-infected monocytes by recombinant interleukin 2-activated natural killer cells.
 Natural killer (NK) cells have long been known to aid in the control of viral infections by killing virus-infected cells, including those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
 Among the possible NK-susceptible target cells in an infected individual, the monocyte/macrophages are of special significance since they may serve as both a reservoir of HIV and aid in dissemination of the virus throughout the body.
 A new technique for the enrichment and cultivation of large numbers of recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2)-stimulated NK cells has been developed which provides cells with high cytotoxic activity.
 These IL-2-activated NK cells, adherent lymphokine-activated killer cells (A-LAK), can kill monocytes infected with HIV for 24 h to 7 days, with optimal target sensitivity between 3 and 7 days.
 Recognition and killing of the infected monocytes did not appear to be restricted by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and could be cold-target inhibited by tumor cell lines.
 A-LAK cells may be useful in newer therapeutic approaches to treatment of HIV infection.
