Angiotropic (intravascular) large cell lymphoma. A clinicopathologic study of seven cases with unique clinical presentations.
 The authors recently reported the antigenic phenotypes of three cases of so-called "malignant angioendotheliomatosis" and suggested that angiotropic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a more appropriate designation for this disease.
 The authors now report an additional seven cases of ALCL with unique clinical presentations.
 One patient presented with prostate enlargement, the second with lytic bone lesions and thickened nasal sinus mucosa, the third had diffuse myalgia, the fourth had dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates, the fifth had gangrene of the lower extremities, total-body skin involvement, and pancytopenia, the sixth had a lesion of the foreskin mimicking squamous cell carcinoma, and the seventh had a mediastinal mass.
 In all cases histologic features were characteristic of ALCL with, in two cases, extravascular spread into soft tissue.
 Immunohistologic studies showed a B-cell phenotype in five cases and a T-cell phenotype in one case.
 Two patients received combination chemotherapy using established treatment protocol for large cell lymphoma, and remain in complete clinical remission and two patients are responding clinically to combination chemotherapy.
 Two patients died shortly after receiving combination chemotherapy.
 One patient has only recently been diagnosed as having ALCL and no long-term follow-up is available.
 These data indicate that, although ALCL affects predominantly the central nervous system and skin, unusual clinical presentations may occur, and patients with ALCL may respond to combination chemotherapy for large cell lymphoma.
