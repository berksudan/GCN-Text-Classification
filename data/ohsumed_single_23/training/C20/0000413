Reactive airway dysfunction syndrome in three police officers following a roadside chemical spill.
 The reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS) is a recently described syndrome in which bronchial hyperreactivity and asthmatic symptoms develop in previously healthy individuals after a single large exposure to an irritating gas, fume, or vapor.
 We report a cluster of three Philadelphia police officers who developed RADS after a common exposure to toxic fumes from a roadside truck accident.
 Results of initial pulmonary function testing were normal in all three, and methacholine challenge was required for diagnosis in two out of the three.
 This syndrome needs to be recognized by physicians dealing with environmental or industrial medicine as a potential cause of loss of work or inability to perform on the job.
 Also, there is a potential for multiple individuals to develop this syndrome from a single incident.
