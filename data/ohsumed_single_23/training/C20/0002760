Dust mite assays in clinical allergy practice: mite antigen exposures among skin test positive patients in Kansas.
 We have attempted to determine whether sensitive monoclonal antibody assays for Dermatophagoides mite antigens Der p I and Der f I can be carried out in a private clinical allergy practice laboratory, to ascertain incidence of significant home mite exposure in dust samples from patient homes in Kansas, and to consider whether such information impacts on patient management.
 We analyzed 152 dust samples from 62 patient homes.
 All patients were skin prick test positive for one or both common mite species available for skin testing, and had potentially relevant histories.
 Der p I and Der f I antigen levels were added together, and levels above 2 micrograms/g of dust were considered "positive." By this definition, elevated levels were found in at least one sample from 48 of 62 homes tested (77%); however, 61% of mattress samples tested, 41% of carpet samples, and 54.5% of furniture samples had levels below those considered likely to cause symptoms.
 Only 13 of 152 samples yielded Der p I levels above 2 micrograms/g.
 We conclude that monoclonal antibody assays for Der p I and Der f I antigens can be performed in a well-equipped office laboratory staffed by trained medical technologists, that Der f I is the predominant mite species in Kansas, and that data derived from mite assays may be important in treatment planning for patients suspected of having mite-related allergy symptoms.
