Anaphylaxis to grand keyhole limpet (abalone-like shellfish) and abalone.
 We report five patients who developed moderate to severe anaphylactic reactions induced by the ingestion of grand keyhole limpet (GKL) and abalone.
 Specific IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to these shellfish was demonstrated by history, prick skin test, and RAST.
 RAST inhibition technique revealed the cross-antigenicity between GKL, abalone, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin.
