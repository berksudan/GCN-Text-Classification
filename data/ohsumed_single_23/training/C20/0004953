Evaluation of the AIDS dementia complex in clinical trials.
 The AIDS dementia complex (ADC) is one of the most common and important causes of morbidity associated with infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).
 The evaluation of ADC in clinical trials is significant not only because of the clinical impact of this syndrome, but also because of the value of measuring its cardinal features as an index of drug efficacy and because of its emerging role as a major clinical end point.
 The objectives of therapy include both prevention of ADC in the presymptomatic patient and alleviation of established disease.
 At present, the pathogenesis of ADC is incompletely understood in several critical aspects, particularly the processes underlying the clinical manifestations of central nervous system (CNS) HIV-1 infection and, further, how such processes are related to systemic disease.
 Consequently, it is not yet clear to what extent, or in which patients, it is necessary to achieve "therapeutic" drug levels within the CNS.
 Nevertheless, the assessment of ADC prevention and treatment relies principally on the complementary approach of neurological examination for diagnosis and neuropsychological testing for quantitative serial measurement of treatment effects.
 Additionally, surrogate markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may hold promise for objective, rapid assessment of treatment response and dose adjustment.
 Other measurements, including more routine CSF analysis, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological assessments, are used principally for differential diagnosis rather than for monitoring ADC status.
 Accumulating experience with available antiviral agents suggests that ADC can be effectively prevented and treated, at least for some period of time, and that assessment of this condition is indeed a valuable approach for measuring antiviral therapy.
