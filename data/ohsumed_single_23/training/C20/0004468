Salsalate cross-sensitivity in aspirin-sensitive patients with asthma.
 Ten aspirin (ASA)-sensitive patients with asthma underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenges with salsalate followed by ASA-sensitive confirmatory challenges.
 All 10 patients sustained asthmatic reactions to ASA, but only two developed respiratory reactions to 2 gm of salsalate.
 In these two patients, repeat confirmatory challenges with 2 gm of salsalate reproduced the same asthmatic reactions.
 Both patients were desensitized to ASA, and cross-desensitization with 2 gm of salsalate was then achieved.
 We conclude that salsalate, a weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenase in vitro, is less likely than ASA to induce asthma in known ASA-sensitive patients with asthma but may occasionally cross-react in these patients.
 Such reactions were mild and easily treated with beta 2-agonists.
