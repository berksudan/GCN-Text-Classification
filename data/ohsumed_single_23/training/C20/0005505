Myelin basic protein-specific T lymphocyte lines from MS patients and healthy individuals.
 We derived a total of 146 T lymphocyte lines specific for human myelin basic protein (MBP) from the peripheral blood of 20 MS patients and from a control group of 12 healthy donors, and determined the reactivities of T cell lines by [3H]thymidine incorporation on exposure to MBP and MBP peptides 1-44, 45-89, and 90-170.
 We defined HLA restriction of the T lines by using monoclonal antibodies against monomorphic determinants on human HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP molecules.
 MBP-specific T cell lines could be isolated with a comparable efficiency from MS patients and healthy individuals.
 In both groups, MBP-specific T lymphocytes recognized at least 4 different epitopes in the MBP molecule, and specificities showed comparable patterns for different MBP peptides.
 MBP-specific T cell lines derived from MS patients and controls were restricted by DR products of the human major histocompatibility class II locus.
 Notable phenotypic differences of T cell lines existed between the 2 groups.
 Lines isolated from MS patients expressed predominantly the CD3+ CD4+ CD8- phenotype, while some control lines were composed of up to 87% CD3+CD4+CD8+ T lymphocytes.
 These findings illustrate the presence of MBP-specific T cells in MS patients and controls that are similarly sensitized to MBP and restricted by HLA-DR products.
