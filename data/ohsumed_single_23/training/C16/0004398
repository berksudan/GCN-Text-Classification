Comparative value of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography in the assessment of congenital abnormalities of the atrioventricular junction.
 Information obtained from transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (two-dimensional echocardiography with spectral Doppler and color flow imaging) was compared in 17 patients with major congenital abnormalities of the atrioventricular (AV) junction (10 discordant AV connections, 1 criss-cross connection, 5 absent right connections and 1 absent left connection).
 The findings by either technique were correlated with findings at cardiac catheterization (12 patients) and at surgery (5 patients).
 In two of six patients with an absent AV connection as defined by transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal imaging demonstrated an imperforate AV valve.
 In 11 of 11 patients with a discordant or criss-cross connection, assessment of AV valve and ventricular morphology (by defining the chordal attachments of both AV valves) was possible with transesophageal echocardiography (3 of 11 patients by transthoracic echocardiography); chordal straddling was detected in 1 patient and excluded in 3 others with an associated inlet ventricular septal defect.
 Anomalous pulmonary venous connection (one patient), atrial septal defect (three patients) and subpulmonary stenosis (five patients) were better assessed by transesophageal imaging, and atrial appendage morphology could be demonstrated in all.
 The transesophageal technique was less useful in demonstrating the anterior subaortic infundibulum or aortopulmonary shunt (two patients).
 Although systemic ventricular function could be assessed by either method with use of short-axis M-mode scans, transesophageal pulsed Doppler interrogation of AV valve and pulmonary venous flow patterns provided clues to diastolic dysfunction of the systemic ventricle.
