Results of a 25-year screening programme for neonatal hip instability.
 From 1962 to 1986, 117,256 neonates were screened for congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH).
 When the primary physical examination was performed by the junior paediatric staff there was a persistent late diagnosis rate of 0.5 per 1000 live births.
 When the primary examination was undertaken by experienced orthopaedic personnel (1982 to 1984) the late diagnosis rate fell and fewer infants were splinted.
