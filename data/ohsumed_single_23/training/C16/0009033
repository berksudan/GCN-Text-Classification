Neonatal ethics: development of a consultative group.
 Experience of a neonatal ethics advisory group in a tertiary care setting was reviewed to identify which aspects of the experience have been most valuable in the development of a consultative group.
 Consultations were requested for 31 patients seen from August 1984 through December 1988.
 Review of these patients indicated that 21 of 31 infants were born after full-term gestations, 11 of 31 infants were seen beyond the neonatal period, and some type of congenital anomaly was the principal diagnosis for 64.7% of the patients.
 The reasons for seeking consultation primarily involved decisions regarding withdrawal or withholding of treatment.
 For 22 of the 31 patients, the consensus of the group supported the decision of the health care team.
 In the remaining consultations, the recommendation of the group was that more information and/or communication was needed.
 In the analysis of the neonatal ethics advisory group's experience with consultations the characteristics of neonatal patients were identified and the value of having a forum for discussing the difficult ethical issues facing members of the health care team were validated.
