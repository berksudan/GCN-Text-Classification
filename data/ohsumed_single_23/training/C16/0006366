Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening activities of state health agencies: a survey 
 Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening has been demonstrated to be cost-effective on a population basis and is becoming standard practice.
 The American Society of Human Genetics has twice published policy statements to define the essential elements of a quality screening program.
 The present study reviewed the impact of these policy statements on state public-health agencies with respect to regulation or provision of MSAFP screening in their jurisdictions.
 With a few exceptions, states have not elected to play a major role in provision or regulation of this test.
 There is need to address issues of funding, standards, and data collection in a collaborative effort, if policy statements on genetic services are to be translated into effective state population screening.
