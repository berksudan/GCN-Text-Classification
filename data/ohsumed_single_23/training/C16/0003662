Teratogenically induced fetal anomalies.
 A variety of infectious and physical agents, maternal diseases and altered metabolic states, and drugs and chemicals have been shown to cause postnatal structural or functional disabilities when embryonic or fetal exposure occurs during human pregnancy.
 These disabilities are potentially preventable through public education and awareness.
 Health-care providers must be equipped to collect relevant data regarding exposures of concern from their pregnant patients, locate and evaluate pertinent current teratology information resources, and sensitively counsel these women regarding the associated potential teratogenic risks.
 Comprehensive care of the patient exposed to a human teratogen may also include discussion of prenatal diagnostic procedures and other pregnancy management options.
