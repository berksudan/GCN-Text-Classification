Norwood operation for univentricular heart with subaortic stenosis in the neonate.
 In the setting of a single ventricle, subaortic stenosis may be enhanced by pulmonary artery banding and may later contraindicate a Fontan operation.
 The Norwood operation may prove a preferable alternative in some infants as a preparatory procedure.
 We have successfully used this procedure as the initial operation to palliate a newborn with tricuspid atresia, transposition of the great arteries, coarctation, and severe arch hypoplasia secondary to a restrictive bulboventricular foramen.
