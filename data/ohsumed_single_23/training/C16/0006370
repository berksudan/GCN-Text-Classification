Localization of the microsatellite probe DXS426 between DXS7 and DXS255 on Xp and linkage to X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.
 The microsatellite marker DXS426 maps to the interval Xp21.1-Xp11.21, the chromosomal region which contains two loci for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP; RP2 and RP3).
 We have refined the localization of DXS426 both physically, by mapping it to a deletion which spans the interval Xp21.3-Xp11.23, and genetically, by studying multiply informative crossovers which indicate that DXS426 lies between DXS7 and DXS255 (i.e., Xp11.4-Xp11.22).
 As this is the region which contains the RP2 gene, RP2 families could be identified on the basis of linkage of XLRP to DXS426.
 Multiply informative crossovers in two RP2 families indicate that the most likely location of the RP2 gene is between DXS426 and DXS7.
 DXS426 is therefore an important highly informative marker for the purposes of carrier detection and early diagnosis of RP2 and for the localization of the disease gene.
