Use of a palatal stabilizing device in prevention of palatal grooves in premature infants.
 A prospective, randomized study using an acrylic palatal stabilizing device (PSD) was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this device in preventing disruptions in palatal architecture.
 A total of 26 premature infants with birth weights of 540 to 1740 g, and intubated orally for a period varying from 7 to 109 days were randomized to control and experimental groups.
 All neonates in the control group developed palatal grooving ranging from 2 to 5 mm in depth, whereas those in the experimental group (with a PSD) showed no evidence of palatal grooving.
 We conclude that a PSD is an effective preventive device in premature orally intubated infants.
