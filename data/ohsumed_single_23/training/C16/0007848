Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of congenital dislocation of the hips.
 Magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained preoperatively and postoperatively for 12 pediatric patients with congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH).
 The images were compared with arthrograms and computed tomography scans.
 The MR images were more accurate in defining soft-tissue anatomy, hip position, and obstructive factors to relocation.
 MR imaging is an efficient diagnostic tool in CDH.
