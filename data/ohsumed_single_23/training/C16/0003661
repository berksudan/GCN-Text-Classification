Clinical approach to prenatal detection of human structural defects.
 Tremendous advances in prenatal diagnosis have allowed clinicians to recognize a variety of structural defects in the developing fetus.
 Guidelines for fetal ultrasonography and an approach to fetal evaluation are outlined.
 The developmental morphologic approach is emphasized as a way of categorizing congenital anomalies whether they are detected during prenatal or postnatal life.
 The use of this approach for diagnosing and managing fetal malformation syndromes is illustrated.
