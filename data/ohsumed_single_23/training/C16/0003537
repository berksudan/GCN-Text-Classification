Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return.
 Anomalous pulmonary venous return from the left lung is an extremely rare condition that is reported sporadically and in general in case reports.
 From 1964 through 1988, we identified 13 patients with this condition, all of whom underwent surgical correction.
 This represents the single largest reported institutional experience with this anomaly.
 The patients ranged in age from 15 months to 40 years.
 Seven were asymptomatic, and six had symptoms ranging from recurrent pulmonary infection to moderate congestive heart failure.
 Six had anomalous venous return from the entire left lung, and seven had anomalous return from the upper lobe only.
 Eight of the patients had associated cardiovascular anomalies.
 Four of the patients underwent surgical correction via a sternotomy approach with cardiopulmonary bypass to allow correction of coexisting intracardiac anomalies.
 The remaining patients underwent surgical repair through a left thoracotomy.
 The technique included high ligation and division of a persistent left superior vena cava with anastomosis to the left atrium at the site of partial excision of the atrial appendage.
 There were no deaths and only one complication in our series.
