Cardiac transplantation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome: a modified technique [see comment]
 A modified technique of infant orthotopic cardiac transplantation with arch reconstruction using bicaval cannulation is described, and the results in 4 infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome are presented.
 This technique minimizes donor myocardial ischemic time and recipient circulatory arrest time.
