Hypergammaglobulinemic purpura of Waldenstrom.
 Hypergammaglobulinemic purpura of Waldenstrom is characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia, recurring purpura, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the presence of rheumatoid factor indicative of circulating immune complexes.
 There is a significant association with autoimmune diseases, especially Sjogren's syndrome and lupus erythematosus.
 Hypergammaglobulinemic purpura is considered primary when there is no other associated disease or secondary when associated with other diseases, usually autoimmune.
 Immune derangements are fundamental in its pathogenesis, although its cause is still unknown.
 Therapy is unrewarding and is probably unnecessary for this usually benign condition.
 Three cases are presented that are representative of patients with hypergammaglobulinemic purpura.
