Newborn screening for sickle cell disease. When is an infant 'lost to follow-up'?
 Success of programs to screen newborns for sickle cell disease depends on timely follow-up.
 Education regarding fever and splenic palpation, and initiation of prophylactic penicillin therapy, will reduce morbidity and mortality and should occur prior to 4 months of age.
 However, contacting parents to permit implementation of care may be difficult, particularly in large urban populations; only nine (36%) of 25 infants recently identified as having sickle cell disease arrived at our institution for initial appointments.
 Medical providers must be aware of medical and legal obligations related to follow-up of newborns with sickle cell disease to prevent untoward events in "missed cases.".
