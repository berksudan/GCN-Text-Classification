Detection of drug-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies by antigen-capture ELISA and flow cytometry.
 The effectiveness of flow cytometry in the detection of drug-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies was investigated.
 In studies of seven sera known to contain quinine- or quinidine-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies, flow cytometry was 5 to 10 times more sensitive in detecting drug-dependent antibodies (DDAbs) than the 51Cr release assay, antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and indirect immunofluorescence microscopic assay.
 With flow cytometry, DDAbs could be detected at drug concentrations as low as 0.1 microM, or less than one-tenth the level required with other methods.
 Antigen-capture ELISA was not as sensitive as flow cytometry in DDAb detection, but it did allow identification of the DDAbs' target molecules.
 With this assay, five of the seven DDAbs recognized both the glycoprotein Ib/IX (GPIb/IX) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) complexes, while the remaining two sera reacted only with GPIb/IX.
 Of 44 consecutive patients who developed thrombocytopenia while taking quinidine, DDAbs were detected by flow cytometry in 11 (25%), more than twice the number detected by other methods.
 In one patient who developed thrombocytopenia while taking trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, DDAbs could be detected only by flow cytometry.
 It can be concluded that flow cytometry is highly sensitive in detecting DDAbs and allows their detection at pharmacologic concentrations of the drug.
 Most quinidine-dependent antibodies recognize at least two different glycoprotein complexes in the platelet membrane.
