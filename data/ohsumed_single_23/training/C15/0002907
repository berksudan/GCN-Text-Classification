Prognosis of chronic granulomatous disease.
 The records of 28 patients with chronic granulomatous disease born over a 32 year period were reviewed.
 The characteristics of the group, and the frequency with which various clinical and laboratory features had been recorded, was assessed.
 Nine patients were known to have died, in most cases of progressive suppurative infection.
 Actuarial analysis showed 50% survival through the third decade of life.
 The long term survival of patients developing symptoms after the end of the first year of life was significantly better than that of patients whose illness started in infancy.
 Our data confirm that the severity of chronic granulomatous disease is not uniform, and that the prognosis for long term survival is better than that suggested in earlier reports.
 Early onset may be a poor prognostic sign and invasive aspergillosis is a life threatening complication.
 In the absence of curative treatment, trials to assess the effectiveness of interferon gamma are necessary and early antenatal diagnosis should be offered to as many affected families as possible.
