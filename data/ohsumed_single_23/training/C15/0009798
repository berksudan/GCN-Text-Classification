Colony-stimulating factors.
 Recombinant hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors have profound effects on developing and mature granulocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes.
 Use of these agents for treatment of disease may result in a variety of adverse cutaneous reactions.
 The recent discovery of colony-stimulating factor production by keratinocytes and dermal cells suggests that these agents may also be significant in cutaneous homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of cutaneous diseases.
