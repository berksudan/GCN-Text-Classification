Primary splenic lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease.
 A case of lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease is described for the purpose of reviewing the criteria currently used to distinguish this disease from other pleomorphic large-cell malignancies.
 A 76-year-old man with a 3-month history of daily fevers underwent extensive evaluation and exploratory laparotomy, which revealed only two large, separate splenic tumor nodules.
 Postoperatively, the patient remained asymptomatic.
 Histologically, the tumor was composed of giant cells, including both typical Reed-Sternberg forms and mononuclear variants with inflammatory stromal response along its borders.
 Immunoperoxidase showed tumor cells to be strongly reactive for Leu-M1 (CD15), BER-H2 (CD30), Leu-3 (CD4), and T11 (CD2) and weakly reactive for Leu-4 (CD3) but nonreactive for EMA, LCA, lysozyme, Leu-9, Leu-M3, Leu-M5, and immunoglobulin light chains.
 Southern blot analysis revealed an isolated clonal band for kappa light chain only.
 Included in the discussion of this case of primary splenic lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease is a review of clinical, histologic, immunohistochemical, and gene-rearrangement characteristics of what can be defined as lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease.
