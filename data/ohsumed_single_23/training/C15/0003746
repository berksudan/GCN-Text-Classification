Cardiac abnormalities in children with sickle cell anemia.
 The cardiac status of 64 children (ages 0.2 to 18 yr) with sickle cell anemia documented by hemoglobin electrophoresis was evaluated by echocardiography.
 Left atrial, left ventricular and aortic root dimensions were significantly increased in over 60 percent of these children at all ages compared to values for 99 normal black (non-SCA) control subjects.
 Left ventricular wall thickness was increased in only 20 percent of older children with sickle cell anemia.
 Estimated LV mass/m2 and left ventricular cardiac index were increased compared to control subjects (p less than 0.001).
 Left heart abnormalities expressed as a single composite function, derived from multivariate regression analysis, correlated well with severity of anemia expressed as grams of hemoglobin (r = -0.52, p = less than 0.001) and with percentage of hemoglobin S (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001), but not to the same extent with age.
 Echocardiographically assessed left ventricular function at rest was comparable to that of control subjects.
 These data suggest that the major cardiac abnormalities in children are related to the volume overload effects of chronic anemia, and that in this age group, there is no evidence for a distinct "sickle cell cardiomyopathy" or cardiac dysfunction.
