Incubation of platelet concentrates before transfusion does not improve posttransfusion recovery.
 Incubation of stored platelet concentrates (PCs) at 37 degrees C for 1 hour has been reported to result in a better morphology score and improved platelet recovery.
 A study was conducted in adult patients with leukemia to determine whether incubation of stored PCs results in an improved platelet recovery as measured by 10-minute posttransfusion corrected count increments (CCI).
 Eligible patients had platelet counts of less than 30,000 per microL and were clinically stable.
 Patients were transfused with 6 to 10 units of PC stored for 3 days (15 studies) or 4 days (5 studies).
 Platelets were pooled and then split in two equal volumes so that each patient received two sequential half-transfusions, one incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 hour and the other kept at 22 degrees C for 1 hour.
 Patients were randomized as to which half-transfusion was received first.
 The mean CCI of the incubated half-transfusions was 13.6 x 10(3) when they were given first and 14.5 x 10(3) when given second; this was not significantly different from the mean CCI of the nonincubated half-transfusions: 13.8 x 10(3) when they were given first and 13.8 x 10(3) when given second.
 In contrast to earlier reports, it can be concluded that incubation of pooled PCs does not improve platelet recovery.
