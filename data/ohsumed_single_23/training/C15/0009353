Normal reticulin level in iliac bone marrow.
 While the level of marrow reticulin may be a factor that is used when the presence of a hematologic disorder is being considered, to our knowledge no study has graded the amount of reticulin present in normal iliac bone marrow.
 Grading reticulin stains of bone biopsy specimens from 100 hematologically normal patients documented that the normal amount of reticulin in the marrow is low.
 Twenty-seven percent of the patients had marrow reticulin grade 0 using the Bauermeister scale, 42% had grade N, 27% had grade 1, and 4% had grade 2; no patient had a Bauermeister grade 3 or 4 reticulin level.
 Knowledge of the normal range of reticulin is essential when the reticulin level is used as a factor in evaluating the possibility of a hematologic disorder.
