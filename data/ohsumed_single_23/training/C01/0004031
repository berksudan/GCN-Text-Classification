Infection control in the nursing home: the physician's role.
 Infection control in the nursing home or long-term care facility is an increasingly complex activity.
 The high rates (approximately 15%) and special risks (group activities, crowding) for nosocomial infection demand special attention by attending physicians.
 Some specific responsibilities include: recognition of infection; knowledge and use of basic infection control principles; appropriate antibiotic use; review of immunizations; facilitation of communications among office, hospital, and long-term care facility; and involvement with infection control program(s).
