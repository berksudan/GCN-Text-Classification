Itraconazole treatment of phaeohyphomycosis.
 Nineteen patients with phaeohyphomycosis were treated with itraconazole.
 Of these, 17 were assessable for clinical outcome.
 Of these, two had received no prior therapy, five had failed amphotericin B therapy, four had failed ketoconazole or miconazole therapy, and five had failed both amphotericin B and azole therapy.
 One patient had received only prior surgical intervention.
 Fungi of seven different genera caused disease of the skin in nine patients, soft tissue in nine, sinuses in eight, bone in five, joints in two, and lungs in two.
 Itraconazole was given in dosages ranging from 50 to 600 mg/day for 1 to 48 months.
 Clinical improvement or remission occurred in nine patients.
 Two patients have had stabilization of disease.
 Six patients failed treatment, one had a relapse after initially successful treatment.
 Itraconazole appears to be highly effective in some patients with phaeohyphomycosis, including patients refractory to other antifungal agents.
