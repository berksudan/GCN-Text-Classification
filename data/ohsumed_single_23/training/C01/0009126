A resurgence of acute rheumatic fever in a mid-South children's hospital.
 A resurgence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) has been reported in many areas of the United States in recent years.
 We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of inpatients with a new diagnosis of ARF from 1982 through 1988 at a children's hospital that serves a six-state referral area in the mid-South.
 Thirty patients were identified, 21 of whom were seen in 1987 (13) and 1988 (8).
 The rate of new cases of ARF per 1000 hospital discharges (0.7) was significantly greater for 1987 and 1988 than it was (0.15) from 1982 through 1986.
 Patients with recently diagnosed ARF were predominantly from nonurban areas, and polyarthritis was the most common recent major manifestation.
 Reasons for the resurgence of ARF in the US, including the mid-South, are unclear, but our experience serves to support recently published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of streptococcal pharyngitis in light of this resurgence of ARF.
