Prevalence and diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia: a 3-year prospective study with emphasis on application of urinary antigen detection.
 During a 3-year period the frequency of legionellosis in hospitalized patients with community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias was 3.4% (23/684 cases) and 5.9% (33/559), respectively.
 Of the diagnostic tests evaluated, detection of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine had the highest sensitivity, with 86% of culture-proven cases being positive.
 Sensitivities of serologic tests and examination of respiratory secretions (culture and direct immunofluorescence) were 36% and 26%, respectively.
 The diagnostic value of serology and of examination of respiratory secretions can be low when specimens are obtained and processed under the typical conditions of hospitalization.
 Urinary antigen detection represents an important diagnostic addition, and examination of postmortem lung tissue from fatal cases with pneumonia is an important adjunct for estimating the prevalence of legionellosis and for assessing the effectiveness of premortem diagnostic tests.
