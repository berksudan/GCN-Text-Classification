The national immunization program of The Netherlands.
 After a brief explanation of the immunization policy in the Netherlands, the national immunization program is described, with special attention given to coupling of the municipal population records with a computerized database of individual immunization records at the provincial level.
 The Dutch program achieves coverage rates greater than 90% for all routine immunizations.
 Participation in the program is free of charge to every child living in the country up to the age of 13 years, but there is no obligation or requirement to be immunized.
 Financing of the program is also discussed.
