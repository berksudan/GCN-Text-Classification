Evidence for gonococcal transmission within a correctional system.
 In a study to examine sexually transmissible disease occurring within a large correctional system where sexual activity is prohibited, 27 male inmates acquired culture-proven gonorrhea from in-jail sexual activity during a three-month period.
 These results provide evidence to encourage inmate education about the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and to support condom distribution programs in correctional facilities.
