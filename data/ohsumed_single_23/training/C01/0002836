Congenital insensitivity to pain with neuroparalytic keratitis.
 Congenital insensitivity to pain is a well-defined entity in the group of sensory deficiency syndromes.
 To the best of our knowledge, unilateral neuroparalytic keratitis associated with congenital insensitivity to pain has not been reported.
 We report such a case to alert clinicians to this potentially blinding problem.
