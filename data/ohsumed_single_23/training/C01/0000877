Itraconazole in common dermatophyte infections of the skin: fixed treatment schedules.
 Itraconazole is an effective medication against the most common dermatophytoses.
 It has been shown to be more active than griseofulvin and ketoconazole.
 Ease of use, affinity for keratinized tissues, lack of toxicity, continued activity after discontinuation, and the possibility of using fixed schedules are advantages of itraconazole.
 The fixed schedules indicated by pharmacokinetics and clinical studies are one 100 mg capsule daily for 15 days in cases of tinea corporis and tinea cruris and the same dosage for 30 days in cases of tinea pedis and tinea manuum.
 These fixed treatments have some limitations, and they are not recommended for treating tinea capitis and tinea unguium.
 The drug is well tolerated.
