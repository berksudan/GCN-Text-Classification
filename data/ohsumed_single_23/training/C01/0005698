Mycoplasmal pneumonia. Are you thinking of atypical presentations?
 The presentations of mycoplasmal pneumonia can be varied and sometimes complicated.
 The atypical nature of this illness, as opposed to the clear pattern of findings in classic bacterial pneumonias, leads the physician to the diagnosis.
 Appropriate therapy then allows quick improvement as a rule, with few sequelae.
