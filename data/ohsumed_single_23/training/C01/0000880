Treatment of oral candidosis with itraconazole: a review.
 Oral candidosis is a common infection in infants, elderly persons, patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
 The orally active antifungal agent itraconazole has been evaluated in a number of different patient populations with oral and oropharyngeal candidosis.
 Initial studies have shown that itraconazole, 100 or 200 mg/day for 14 days, is more active than placebo in treating oral candidosis.
 A comparative study between itraconazole capsules (200 mg once daily) and clotrimazole troches (10 mg five times daily) showed equivalent results at the end of therapy but a significantly faster response to itraconazole and a faster relapse rate with clotrimazole.
 A study in AIDS patients with oropharyngeal candidosis demonstrated that itraconazole, 200 mg/day, and ketoconazole, 400 mg day, for 4 weeks give equivalent clinical cure rates and similar relapse rates.
 A pilot study with an oral solution of itraconazole has given an impressive 100% clinical and mycological response rate within 1 week of treatment.
 In conclusion, itraconazole in capsule or in solution form may constitute a major addition to the armamentarium of drugs against oropharyngeal candidosis.
