Infectious diseases as a Canadian subspecialty, with projections to the year 2000.
 Infectious diseases is a relatively new subspecialty in Canada.
 During the past decade, however, important advances have been made.
 These include the formation of the Canadian Infectious Diseases Society and the development of the first Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons examinations in the subspecialty of infectious diseases.
 The majority of Canadians training for practice in the field of infectious diseases are now enrolled in programs in Canada.
 Despite predictions in the United States of an excess of physicians who specialize in infectious diseases, such a situation has not occurred in Canada.
 More physicians with training in infectious diseases will be required in Canada in the next decade to fill positions in patient care, microbiology (for individuals with both clinical and laboratory training), research, epidemiology and infection control, programs related to human immunodeficiency virus infections, geographic and international medicine, the pharmaceutical industry, and education and administration.
 In Canada, the extent to which infectious diseases physicians are involved in these areas varies from that in the United States.
 This review suggests a continued need for physicians with appropriate training in infectious diseases.
