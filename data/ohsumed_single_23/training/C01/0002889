In vitro susceptibility of Xanthomonas (Pseudomonas) maltophilia to newer antimicrobial agents.
 The susceptibilities of 45 clinical and 3 environmental isolates of Xanthomonas maltophilia to 14 antimicrobial agents was determined by broth microdilution.
 The newer quinolones PD117596, PD117558, PD127391, A-56620, amifloxacin, and fleroxacin were the most active agents tested, with 70 to 99% of isolates being susceptible to these agents.
 All isolates were resistant to trospectomycin.
 The new aminoglycosides SCH24120 and SCH22591 were active against 12 and 1% of isolates, respectively.
