Prevention of infection in a porous tracheal prosthesis by omental wrapping.
 The ideal tracheal prosthesis has to permit complete incorporation by epithelialization of the luminal surface.
 This is not possible with the currently available impermeable solid silicone tube.
 The authors developed a reinforced, porous polyurethane tubular prosthesis which has the potential for complete incorporation.
 However, because these prostheses are implanted in a contamined area such as the airway, they all become infected.
 In order to prevent infection, the authors evaluated the effect of omental wrapping in guinea pigs.
 The authors' tubular prosthesis was implanted subcutaneously in the abdominal area with the ends open to the air.
 Ten prostheses were wrapped with omentum and 10 prostheses were not.
 In 4 weeks, all control prostheses were infected and marsupialized.
 All the wrapped prostheses remained in place and were macroscopically not infected.
 Microscopically, all wrapped prostheses were well vascularized and were incorporated by granulation tissue, which did not occur in the prostheses of the control group.
 From these results the authors conclude that omental wrapping would be an effective way to prevent infection of porous tracheal prostheses in an open-to-the-air situation, and allow rapid tissue ingrowth and incorporation in the host.
