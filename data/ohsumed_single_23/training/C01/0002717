hemofiltration reverses left ventricular dysfunction during sepsis in dogs.
 Depressed left ventricular (LV) contractility in sepsis has been ascribed to the presence of circulating cardiodepressant substance (filterable cardiodepressant factor in sepsis [FCS]); however, this finding is controversial.
 The authors hypothesized that if a decrease in LV contractility indeed occurred due to a circulating depressant substance, then removal of this substance by hemofiltration would reverse by dysfunction.
 In this study, LV mechanics were examined before and after hemofiltration in anesthetized dogs during continuous intravenous infusion of live Escherichia coli.
 Left ventricular anterior-posterior and apex-base dimensions were measured by subendocardial ultrasonic crystal transducers implanted 4 weeks before the experiments.
 Left ventricular contractility was determined from the end-systolic pressure-dimension relationship.
 The slope of this relationship (Emax) is an index of contractility.
 After 4 h of sepsis, Emax was reduced by one half.
 Hemofiltration resulted in a return of Emax to control values.
 The FCS activity in the plasma was also assessed by the percent reduction in isometric contraction of electrically stimulated, isolated right ventricular trabeculae obtained from nonseptic dogs.
 The FCS activity reached a peak 4 h after sepsis and was reduced after 2 h of hemofiltration.
 The results show that during experimental sepsis, a circulating substance of less than 30,000 d produces a decrease in LV contractility and that this LV dysfunction may be improved by hemofiltration.
