Protection of mice against the Lyme disease agent by immunizing with recombinant OspA.
 Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne illness caused by Borrelia burgdorferi.
 The gene for outer surface protein A (OspA) from B.
 burgdorferi strain N40 was cloned into an expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli.
 C3H/HeJ mice actively immunized with live transformed E.
 coli or purified recombinant OspA protein produced antibodies to OspA and were protected from challenge with several strains of B.
 burgdorferi.
 Recombinant OspA is a candidate for a vaccine for Lyme borreliosis.
