Intraamniotic infection in the very early phase of the second trimester.
 A total of 157 consecutive patients were studied in an effort to examine prospectively the incidence of asymptomatic intraamniotic infection in the early phase of the second trimester.
 All patients were referred for amniotic fluid karyotyping.
 In addition, the amniotic fluids were examined for Gram stain and were directly cultured on blood agar and MacConkey agar as well as in thioglycollate broth.
 We found positive amniotic fluid cultures in eight cases (5.09%); however, results of Gram stain examinations were negative in all amniotic fluid samples.
 The data indicate that there is no correlation between white blood cells in the amniotic fluid and positive amniotic fluid culture results.
 Only one pregnancy with positive amniotic fluid culture resulted in a septic abortion.
 Therefore we can suggest that intraamniotic infection can exist early in pregnancy, even with intact membranes, and in most cases without any clinical symptoms.
