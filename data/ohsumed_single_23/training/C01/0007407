Postneonatal mortality in Norway: a study of recent trends and comparison with other mortality rates in Norwegian children.
 Postneonatal mortality in Norway decreased rapidly from 1956 to 1980 but subsequently remained stable.
 In recent years the postneonatal death rate appears to be increasing, primarily due to greater numbers of deaths attributed to the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
 During the same period, mortality among older children has also decreased, with the decline evident in all leading causes.
 Only among people aged 15 to 19 years have recent trends been less than encouraging, with the number of fatal traffic accidents in particular remaining stable or increasing.
 Although there is room for continued improvement, the widely held belief that the health status of Norwegian children is good is supported by the trends in mortality.
