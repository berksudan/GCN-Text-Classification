A general model of sexually transmitted disease epidemiology and its implications for control.
 Achieving control of STDs may be possible by integrating the activities discussed previously with further research to provide additional empiric data on sex behavior, to develop innovative strategies to access and communicate with those most at risk of STD (i.e., core-group members), and to foster biologic study of STD pathogens with the goal of vaccine development.
 New strategies to identify core-group members aside from the currently used STD-repeater status would be of immense help in targeting educational efforts, laboratory screening, and vaccines.
 Achieving more complete control of STDs may be possible if recent advances in our understanding of their epidemiology and transmission dynamics can be translated into effective new interventional strategies.
