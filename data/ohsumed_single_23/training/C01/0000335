Superficial cultures in neonatal sepsis evaluations. Impact on antibiotic decision making.
 The authors performed a retrospective analysis of neonatal superficial cultures and their effect on antimicrobial decision making during a nine-month period at Nashville General Hospital.
 They obtained and reviewed charts of infants (n = 66) having paired superficial (skin and/or gastric aspirate) and deep (blood and cerebrospinal fluid) cultures for the evaluation of early-onset sepsis.
 Superficial cultures were positive for pathogens (any streptococcus or enteric gram-negative) in 15% (10/66) of cases.
 Antimicrobial decision making was affected in only one of these cases, and in a seemingly inappropriate manner.
 In summary, there was no evidence or review that superficial cultures used in sepsis evaluation influenced physician antimicrobial decision making; in one case they may have led to unnecessary antibiotic exposure.
