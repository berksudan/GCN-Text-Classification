Effect of blood transfusion on oxygen consumption in pediatric septic shock.
 Treatment plans for pediatric septic shock advocate increasing oxygen consumption (VO2).
 Recent studies in septic shock indicate that improving oxygen delivery (DO2) by increasing blood flow will increase VO2.
 We prospectively examined the effect on VO2 of improving DO2 by increasing oxygen content (CO2) with blood transfusion in eight hemodynamically stable septic shock patients.
 Transfusion consisted of 8 to 10 ml/kg of packed RBC over 1 to 2 h.
 Hemodynamic and oxygen transport measurements were obtained before and after blood transfusion.
 Transfusion significantly (p less than .05) increased Hgb and Hct from 10.2 +/- 0.8 g/dl and 30 +/- 2% to 13.2 +/- 1.4 g/dl and 39 +/- 4%, respectively (mean +/- SD).
 DO2 significantly (p less than .05) increased after transfusion (599 +/- 65 to 818 +/- 189 ml/min.m2), but VO2 did not change (166 +/- 68 to 176 +/- 74 ml/min.m2; NS).
 In pediatric septic shock patients, increasing CO2 by blood transfusion may not increase VO2.
