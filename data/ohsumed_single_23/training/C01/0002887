Activity of compound G2 isolated from alfalfa roots in experimental dermatophyte infection.
 Compound G2 isolated from alfalfa roots was applied topically to skin lesions of guinea pigs experimentally infected with the dermatophyte Trichophyton mentagrophytes var.
 granulare.
 After 12 to 15 applications, 80% of the infected lesions were cured, as judged by clinical and microbial criteria, compared with 20% of the untreated lesions which healed spontaneously (P less than 0.01).
