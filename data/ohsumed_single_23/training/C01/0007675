Group B streptococcus endocarditis following second-trimester abortion.
 An 18-year-old woman who underwent an elective second-trimester abortion developed Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) endocarditis characterized by a large, pedunculated vegetation involving a previously normal tricuspid valve.
 Polyarthritic symptoms, as well as multiple pulmonary emboli, were experienced, and cure followed a course of treatment using intravenous penicillin G potassium combined with gentamicin sulfate.
 Endocarditis caused by this pathogen usually occurs among individuals compromised by underlying chronic disorders and, today, is a rare sequela of pregnancy and abortion.
 When planning therapy, consideration should be given to the possibility of tolerance among clinical isolates and the need for operative intervention in selected patients.
