Itraconazole in tinea versicolor: a review.
 Itraconazole, a new orally active triazole antifungal, has been tested in patients with pityriasis versicolor.
 A number of studies have shown that itraconazole is effective for this mild fungal skin disease.
 The total dose required for effective treatment is 1000 mg, and it has been given as 200 mg for 5 days or 7 days.
 The organisms disappear slowly from the skin, even when dead, and the results should be assessed clinically and mycologically at around 3 to 4 weeks after treatment.
 Numerous studies have shown that itraconazole is superior to placebo and as effective as selenium sulfide, clotrimazole, and ciclopirox olamine.
 It is also better tolerated by patients than selenium sulfide.
