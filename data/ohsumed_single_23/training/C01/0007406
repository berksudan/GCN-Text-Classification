Postneonatal infectious disease mortality: the French situation.
 Mortality caused by infectious and parasitic diseases represents a limited part of all postneonatal deaths in France, which have been stable for the past decade.
 This component is worthy of careful analysis because it is at least partially preventable.
 Statistics are presented and interpreted, with discussion on which disorders should be included in assessing the impact of infection on morbidity and mortality.
 Figures and international rankings change according to the inclusiveness of the definition chosen.
 There is need for epidemiologic and statistical research to make comparisons of mortality more clear.
 Morbidity is also important because of high incidence, frequent hospitalization, and a heavy social cost.
 Policy and services in France that relate to control and treatment of infection are described, as are shortcomings that call for further efforts.
