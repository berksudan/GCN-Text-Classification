Effects of method of hemostasis on wound-infection rate.
 Adequate hemostasis is important in preventing postoperative wound infection.
 This study compared four methods of hemostasis: specific pinpoint vessel electrocautery (SPC), specific vessel ligation with 4-0 vicryl (SVL), nonspecific electrocautery of vessel plus excessive surrounding tissue (NSC), and nonspecific ligation of vessel and excessive surrounding tissue with 4-0 vicryl (NSL), on the rate of wound infection in rabbits that were contaminated with 10(6) Staphylococcus aureus.
 There was no statistical significant increase in the rate of wound sepsis when electrocautery was used in a fashion producing minimal nonviable tissue compared to specific vessel ligation.
 Electrocautery use for specific vessel hemostasis does not result in a higher wound infection rate in contaminated wounds.
