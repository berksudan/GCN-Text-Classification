Tampon absorbency, composition and oxygen content and risk of toxic shock syndrome.
 Tampon use has been identified as a major risk factor for toxic shock syndrome, although the etiologic role of tampons is not clearly understood.
 Two epidemiologic studies conducted to date have reported an association between tampon absorbency and risk of toxic shock syndrome.
 This finding is not corroborated by laboratory studies, however, which have suggested that absorbency may be a marker for other characteristics that create an environment conductive to the elaboration of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1.
 We used data from the previously reported Tri-state study to estimate simultaneously the effects of tampon oxygen content, absorbency and chemical composition.
 Although the data are sparse, oxygen content was more strongly associated with risk of toxic shock syndrome than either absorbency or chemical composition.
 The results suggest that it may be possible to develop a highly absorbent tampon that is not associated with a high risk of toxic shock syndrome.
