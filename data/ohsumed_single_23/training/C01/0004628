Platelet-activating factor or a platelet-activating factor antagonist decreases tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the plasma of mice treated with endotoxin.
 When L-platelet-activating factor (PAF) or alprazolam (a PAF antagonist) was administered to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice, the level of plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha) determined by either ELISA or a cytotoxic assay using WEHI cells was significantly lowered.
 The inactive stereoisomer, D-PAF, was not effective in lowering plasma TNF alpha levels in LPS-treated mice.
 The decrease in plasma TNF alpha induced by L-PAF or alprazolam was partly reversed by indomethacin.
 Despite a decrease in plasma TNF alpha, L-PAF or alprazolam caused an increase in the amount of TNF alpha mRNA present in the kidneys and the livers of LPS-treated mice, suggesting that a posttranscriptional event leading to the synthesis or release of TNF alpha was inhibited by these agents.
