Evaluation of the stimulated menstrual cycle by magnetic resonance imaging.
 Changes in uterine zonal anatomy in six women during a cycle of treatment with clomiphene citrate is studied by magnetic resonance imaging.
 There was a rapid rate of increase in endometrial thickness during the periovulatory period that was similar to the pattern seen in a prior study of women with normal (nonstimulated) cycles.
 Junctional zone thickness did not parallel the endometrial pattern and differed from the response seen in nonstimulated cycles.
 Results of large scale studies may help to further understand the effects of these medications.
