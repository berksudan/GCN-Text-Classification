Establishment of pregnancies in humans after transcervical transfer of gametes immediately after oocyte retrieval.
 This study, like that of Veersema et al.
 demonstrates the feasibility of direct intrauterine transfer of gametes in initiating pregnancy.
 Whether the success of this procedure can be further improved with modification (preincubation, in vitro insemination) remains the subject of continued investigation.
 Notwithstanding this uncertainty, we feel that transcervical transfer of gametes may be an alternative to IVF for patients with ethical concerns regarding IVF.
