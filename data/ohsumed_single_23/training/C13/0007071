The rate of rise of corticotrophin releasing factor and endogenous digoxin-like immunoreactivity in normal and abnormal pregnancy.
 Maternal plasma concentrations of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) and endogenous digoxin-like immunoreactivity (EDLI) were estimated in 80 normal and 88 abnormal pregnancies which were sampled sequentially from 24 weeks gestation to delivery.
 A slope was fitted for each woman's antenatal EDLI and CRF values, both of which rose significantly during gestation, and the mean of the slopes for the normal and abnormal groups for each value compared.
 There was no evidence of significant mean differences between groups for EDLI but there was evidence of a significant mean difference for CRF (P less than 0.05).
 After adjustment for other variables which may affect pregnancy outcome, the slopes for CRF were found not to be significantly related to outcome.
