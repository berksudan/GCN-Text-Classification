Pregnancy and liver transplantation.
 To define the risks and outcomes associated with pregnancy and liver transplantation, we reviewed our experience in managing eight pregnant women who had undergone orthotopic liver transplantation.
 Seven patients conceived after transplantation; the interval from transplantation to conception ranged from 3 weeks to 24 months.
 One patient received an allograft at 26 weeks' gestation for hepatic failure secondary to acute fulminant hepatitis B.
 Of the seven patients who conceived after transplantation, six had live births and one electively terminated her pregnancy.
 Five patients developed worsening hypertension and/or preeclampsia.
 Three patients developed severe preeclampsia and required delivery.
 One patient suffered acute allograft rejection during pregnancy which was successfully treated with corticosteroids.
 Two patients had persistent elevation of serum transaminases and two had severe anemia.
 The mean gestational age at delivery was 32.8 weeks.
 Of the six live births to women who conceived after transplantation, five infants survived and are well and one infant died.
 There were no congenital anomalies.
 All mothers are alive at this time.
 Pregnancy in recipients of hepatic allografts is associated with good perinatal outcome, but there is an increased risk of preeclampsia, worsening hypertension, and preterm delivery.
 Pregnancy does not appear to have a deleterious effect on hepatic graft function or survival.
 Joint management of these patients by a transplant specialist and a perinatologist is essential.
