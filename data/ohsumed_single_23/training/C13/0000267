Epidural analgesia for a parturient with herpes gestationis.
 A 23-yr-old parturient with herpes gestationis spontaneously delivered a normal healthy infant under epidural analgesia.
 She received five injections of bupivacaine 0.5 per cent over a ten-hour period.
 There was no infection at the lumbar region, even though her body was covered with vesicles and bullae including the face and neck.
 Eight months after delivery the patient still has a vesicular eruption which occurs mainly during her menses.
