C-reactive protein in assessing antimicrobial treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
 Serial serum C-reactive protein (CRP) determinations were used in the evaluation of antimicrobial treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) as proven by laparoscopy and endometrial biopsy or microbiologic findings in the upper genital tract in 36 women.
 Sixteen patients were treated with ciprofloxacin and 20 with doxycycline plus metronidazole.
 The mean CRP levels did not differ significantly in patients with severe and moderate salpingitis in comparison with mild salpingitis on admission or during treatment, nor was there any significant difference between the mean CRP levels in patients with acute chlamydial/gonococcal and nonchlamydial/nongonococcal PID.
 The mean CRP levels decreased by the third day of treatment in all treatment groups, and the decrease by the sixth day of treatment was significant (P less than .05), reflecting the clinical response to therapy faster than did serial ESR determinations.
 After the documentation of acute PID, serial serum CRP determinations were a useful predictor of the short-term response to antimicrobial therapy.
