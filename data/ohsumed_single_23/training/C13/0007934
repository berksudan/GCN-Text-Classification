Home monitoring of gonadotropin ovulation induction using the Ovarian Monitor.
 The safe use of gonadotropins relies on close hormonal and/or ultrasound monitoring to assess the response to treatment, requiring multiple hospital visits.
 Home monitoring with the Ovarian Monitor (St.
 Michael Research Foundation, Macleod, Victoria, Australia) minimizes hospital visits and overcomes many of the logistic difficulties associated with gonadotropin use.
 It utilizes a system of homogenous enzyme immunoassay using lysozyme conjugates to measure quantitatively either urinary estrone-3 or pregnanediol-3-glucuronide.
 Results obtained by 24 patients in 57 cycles using the Ovarian Monitor at home correlate closely with results obtained in the laboratory (estrone-3-glucuronide r = 0.955; pregnanediol-3-glucuronide r = 0.958).
 Cycle outcomes (ovulation, 74%/cycle; clinical pregnancy, 30%/cycle; multiple pregnancy, 13%/pregnancy; hyperstimulation, 11%/cycle) are no different from those achieved in laboratory-monitored patients.
 Home monitoring can be as safe and effective as laboratory monitoring, offers significant social benefits, and improves access to this form of therapy.
