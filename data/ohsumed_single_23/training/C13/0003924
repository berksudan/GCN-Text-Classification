Triplet tubal pregnancy treated by outpatient laparoscopic salpingostomy.
 To our knowledge, this represents the first case of a laparoscopically treated triplet EP and the first time that a double EP in the same tube was treated conservatively (with preservation of the tube).
 Multiple EPs may be more common than currently thought, and our report offers an alternative explanation for at least some cases of persistent EP after conservative surgical therapy.
 Finally, given the substantial cost savings and reduced postoperative recovery time associated with operative laparoscopy, when the patient is stable and the surgeon experienced, the laparoscopic approach should be tried, regardless of the number of EPs or their size.
