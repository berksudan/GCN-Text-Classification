The establishment of an ovum donation program using a simple fixed-dose estrogen-progesterone replacement regimen.
 Most ovum donation (OD) programs involve cycle synchronization between recipient and donor for normally cycling recipients and a complex estrogen-progesterone replacement regimen for recipients with ovarian failure.
 In 1987, Serhal and Craft (1) suggested the use of a fixed-dose estrogen-progesterone regimen for recipients who were normally ovulatory and to those with ovarian failure.
 Following this protocol, and simplifying it still, the authors administered 6 mg estradiol valerate (E2) daily orally starting on day 2-6 of induced withdrawal bleeding, augmented with 100 mg progesterone in ethyl oleate (P) intramuscularly daily, starting any time between 4 days prior to and the day of oocyte pickup.
 All recipients underwent embryo transfer at a 2-pronuclei (2PN)-10-cell stage.
 A group of 21 patients underwent 26 treatment cycles, resulting in 16 pregnancies.
 Twelve of the patients gave birth, one to triplets, two to twins, and nine to singletons.
 Four patients miscarried in the first trimester of pregnancy.
