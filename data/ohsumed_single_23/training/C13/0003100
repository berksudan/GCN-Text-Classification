The effect of maternal ethanol infusion on placental blood flow and fetal glucose metabolism in sheep.
 Intravenous infusion of 1 g ethanol/min over 1 hr to seven catheterised pregnant ewes decreased blood flow on both sides of the placenta.
 The reductions in blood flow were maintained for at least 2 hr after the infusion of ethanol had ceased.
 Although blood flow was reduced, fetal blood gases were unchanged.
 Plasma glucose concentrations were unchanged by ethanol, but fetal glucose supply and consumption were both decreased following maternal ethanol infusions.
 If maintained by chronic alcohol consumption these changes could contribute to the growth retardation seen in the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.
