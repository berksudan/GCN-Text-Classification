The value of hysteroscopy in elderly women prior to in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET): a comparative study.
 Two hundred eighty-four hysteroscopies were performed in 312 (91%) candidates for in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) who were divided into two groups.
 Group I consisted of elderly women over 40 years, and group II of women below this age.
 Although visualization revealed uterine abnormalities in 29.9% of all patients, abnormal findings were significantly increased in the former group in comparison to the latter (P less than 0.001).
 This difference was attributed mainly to uterine rather than cervical pathology.
 Furthermore, in elderly women age-related uterine pathology such as submucous myomata, endometrial hyperplasia, and polyps were more prominent, while in younger patients other uterine lesions such as adhesions and tubal ostia occlusion were more common.
 Moreover, treatment prior to IVF-ET resulted in 7 clinical pregnancies (8.9%) in group I and in 41 clinical pregnancies (19.9%) in group II, all of which failed in one to three cycles previously.
 It seems that hysteroscopic evaluation may reduce the IVF-ET failure rate due to intrauterine abnormalities in elderly as well as young patients, thus it becomes an absolute prerequisite for all patients scheduled for an IVF program.
