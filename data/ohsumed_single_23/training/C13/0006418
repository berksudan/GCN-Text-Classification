Continuous or interrupted fascial closure: a prospective evaluation of No. 1 Maxon suture in 402 gynecologic procedures.
 During a 14-month period of using a long-term absorbable suture (No.
 1 Maxon), 402 patients were entered into a prospective, randomized trial of fascial closure.
 Patients were randomized between a continuous closure (201 patients) and an interrupted en bloc (201 patients) technique.
 Each patient was subjected to a preoperative and intraoperative protocol for wound management.
 There were no acute wound failures.
 Wound infection rates and risk of hernia were not apparently affected by closure technique.
