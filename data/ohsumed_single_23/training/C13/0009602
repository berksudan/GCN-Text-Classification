The use of rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps following excision of vulvar cancer.
 Rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps have been used in 16 women following radical excision of extensive vulvar cancer.
 In two women the procedure was part of the primary surgery, in 11 for recurrence of vulvar cancer and in three for symptomatic palliation.
 Fifteen (94%) of the grafts took with primary healing.
 Thirteen of the 16 patients are alive 6-60 months (median 29 months) after surgery and the three who died benefited from symptomatic palliation.
 Simultaneous vulvar reconstruction allows good cosmetic rehabilitation and is an important part of the armamentarium for the management of patients with advanced primary or recurrent vulvar carcinoma.
 This technique offers excellent surgical clearance of massive offensive and painful vulvar tumors.
