Treatment of tubal pregnancy by local injection of methotrexate after adrenaline injection into the mesosalpinx: a report of 25 patients.
 Twenty-five patients with a tubal pregnancy were treated by an injection of methotrexate (MTX) into the tubal swelling after vasoconstriction of the mesosalpinx with adrenaline.
 Twenty-four of the 25 patients had an uneventful clinical course.
 In one case, the tube ruptured despite falling serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations.
 In 17 of 24 patients, the dose of 100 mg that was locally injected was sufficient.
 Seven patients were given additional systemic injections.
 In 3 of the 4 patients with high initial serum hCG levels (greater than 10.000 mIU/mL), the clinical course was uneventful.
 The side effects of MTX and adrenaline were minimal.
 Whether this way of treatment guarantees better chances of fertility in the future is unknown.
 Therefore a prospective, case-controlled study comparing the fertility rates in different ways of treatment is needed.
