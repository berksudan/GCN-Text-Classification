Ectopic pregnancy in adolescents: a clinical review for pediatricians.
 Pediatricians caring for sexually active female adolescents and young adults need to be aware of the history, symptoms, and signs of an ectopic pregnancy.
 A thorough history and physical examination, including the pelvic examination, as well as specific diagnostic tests such as repeated quantitative hCG measurements, and ultrasonography when indicated, are crucial to proper and early diagnosis of a nonruptured ectopic pregnancy manageable by laparoscopy.
 The key to early diagnosis is to include ectopic pregnancy in the differential diagnosis in any sexually active female patient who has abnormal vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain.
 With early diagnosis, close observation, and appropriate management, the outcome is more likely to be favorable, with minimal morbidity and risk of death.
