Menorrhagia.
 Excessive vaginal bleeding, or menorrhagia, is one of the most common presenting symptoms for gynecologic patients.
 Although this disorder has many possible etiologies, it is generally possible to approach its diagnosis and management in an orderly fashion.
 When evaluating the menorrhagic patient, it important to gear the work-up toward a differential diagnosis that includes pregnancy-related causes, hormonal problems, iatrogenic etiologies, mechanical intrauterine disorders, infections of the lower genital tract, and gynecologic cancers (PHIMIC).
 This differential approach can guide the types of historical data obtained from the patient, focus the physical examination, and alert the practitioner to the most appropriate laboratory and radiologic evaluation.
 Therapy can differ widely, depending on the cause of the bleeding.
 Most types of menorrhagia respond to medical therapy with oral contraceptives, oral synthetic estrogens or progestins, and long-acting intramuscular progestins or GnRH agonists.
 Surgical approaches, such as dilatation and curettage or hysterectomy, are less and less a first-line therapy; but innovative surgical techniques such as hysteroscopy and laparoscopic surgery are becoming increasingly important.
 With rapid, goal-directed diagnosis and specific therapy, the medical complications, anxiety, and discomfort suffered by the woman with menorrhagia can be alleviated quickly.
