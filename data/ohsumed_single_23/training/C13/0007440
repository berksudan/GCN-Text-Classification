A new method for the dressing of free skin grafts.
 Using adhesive drapes and a disposable suction drain, a new method for the dressing of free skin grafts has been devised.
 The graft is compressed by pressure that is equivalent to the negative pressure of the suction drain.
 This method can apply uniform and constant pressure on the graft.
 Moreover, the graft can be observed through a transparent drape so that the existence of hematomas can be detected easily.
