Twin pregnancy after diagnosis and treatment of ectopic implantation by retrograde selective salpingography and intraluminal methotrexate injection.
 In this case report, a patient with a right tubal pregnancy was managed by a new procedure combining retrograde salpingography and local MTX injection.
 A twin pregnancy occurred shortly after treatment.
 We conclude that retrograde tubal cannulation may provide an alternative method for the diagnosis and treatment of selected EPs.
