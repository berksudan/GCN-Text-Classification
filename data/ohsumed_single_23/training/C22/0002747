Effects of a 2.15-micron laser on human atherosclerotic xenografts in vivo.
 The thulium-holmium-chromium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (THC:YAG) laser has a tissue effect similar to that of the CO2 laser, with the advantage of transmissibility through flexible fibers.
 The authors used a human-rabbit xenograft model to evaluate the thrombotic and healing responses of atherosclerotic vessels subjected to laser energy.
 Occluded atherosclerotic human coronary artery segments were recanalized in vitro by use of the THC:YAG laser.
 Destruction of plaque by the laser was achieved with minimal collateral thermal damage.
 These vascular segments were then transplanted into the rabbit abdominal aorta.
 The authors observed that the luminal surface of the lased vessels was more thrombogenic than that of the nonlased control vessels.
 However, occlusion of the lased vessels did not occur.
 Repair of laser-treated tissue progressed until a mature, nonthrombogenic fibrin-platelet aggregate was adherent to the luminal wall.
 Overall, the lased vessels behaved in a fashion similar to the nonlased control vessels.
 On the basis of these results, the authors believe that the THC:YAG laser may have use in human angioplasty.
