Synergism between hepatic injuries and a nonhepatotropic reovirus in mice. Enhanced hepatic infection and death.
 Reovirus type 1, after intravenous inoculation in the adult mouse, is secreted via bile into the intestine in an infectious form.
 Although reovirus type 1 is rapidly removed from systemic circulation by the liver and the lung, very few hepatocytes express reovirus antigen during infection.
 In intestinal cells, reovirus replicates selectively in the crypts.
 This site preference may be due to active cell proliferation in the crypts.
 We hypothesized that the state of the cell may affect virus replication and tested this hypothesis by using chemical and surgical means to increase hepatic mitotic activity.
 Adult mice were treated with carbon tetrachloride or surgical trauma, inoculated with reovirus type 1 intravenously, and subsequently killed.
 Virus antigen was identified using a highly specific immunohistochemical technique.
 Liver sections were stained using immunoperoxidase with specific rabbit antireovirus antibody.
 Hepatotoxin and surgical trauma increase reovirus antigen detection in both Kupffer cells and hepatocytes.
 Only the sequential administration of CCl4 and virus caused mortality at doses sublethal for each alone.
 These data demonstrate a synergism between hepatic injury and reovirus which results in a significant increase in the magnitude of viral infection and contributes to mortality.
 Such synergism may be important in idiopathic liver disease.
