Impact of intensive educational approach to dietary change in NIDDM.
 The aim of this study was to compare the effects of an intensive educational approach incorporating longer time, greater simplicity, repetition, and cognitive motivational techniques with a conventional one in subjects with established non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) whose weight, glycemic control, and diet were not optimal.
 Subjects were randomly allocated to intensive or conventional education.
 Of 350 subjects, 70 met the study criteria, which included established NIDDM (greater than or equal to 3 mo), suboptimal recent glycemic control, dietary fat intake greater than or equal to 35% of total energy intake, and body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2.
 The intensive approach was associated with significantly greater improvements in dietary compliance, dietary intake (complex carbohydrate, [P = 0.013], legumes [P less than 0.0001], fiber [P less than 0.0001], total fat [P less than 0.004], saturated fat [P less than 0.004]), and total cholesterol level (P = 0.007).
 The transient improvement in glycemic control was similar in both groups.
 An intensive education program can improve dietary compliance in established NIDDM subjects more than a conventional one.
 These recommended dietary improvements achieve better improvement in total cholesterol but do not necessarily improve glycemic control.
