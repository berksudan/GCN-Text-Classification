Depletion of alcohol (hexanol) dehydrogenase activity in the epidermis and jejunal mucosa in Sjogren-Larsson syndrome.
 Using a histochemical technique, we have demonstrated a consistent deficiency of alcohol (hexanol) dehydrogenase activity within the epidermis and jejunal mucosa of patients with Sjogren-Larsson syndrome.
 Biochemical assay of the fatty alcohol: NAD oxidoreductase activity in cultured fibroblasts and leukocytes from these patients showed deficient activities compared with controls.
 The histochemical and biochemical results are complementary, and the simpler histochemical method can be used reliably for initial screening of patients with ichthyosis in whom a diagnosis of Sjogren-Larsson syndrome is suspected.
