Lowering of plasma glucose concentrations with bezafibrate in patients with moderately controlled NIDDM.
 The goal of this study was to investigate whether treatment with bezafibrate improves glucose tolerance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
 The study included 37 NIDDM patients with HbA1 concentrations greater than 8.5% and normal kidney and liver function who were being treated with diet alone or diet together with a sulfonylurea drug.
 One patient withdrew because of constipation.
 At randomization and after 3 mo of treatment, patients were given a standard mixed-test-meal tolerance test (MTT; 500 cal) after an overnight fast, and plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, metabolite, nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), and triglyceride concentrations were measured at 15- to 30-min intervals.
 Serum lipid, HbA1, and fructosamine concentrations were measured at monthly intervals.
 Glucose, NEFA, and triglyceride concentrations were significantly lower throughout the second MTT in bezafibrate patients (P less than 0.01-0.001) but not in the placebo group.
 Fasting serum insulin and C-peptide levels, but not postprandial concentrations, were reduced only in bezafibrate patients (P less than 0.05).
 After 3 mo, mean fasting serum triglyceride concentrations fell from 2.2 to 1.4 mM (P less than 0.001), total serum cholesterol concentrations from 6.3 to 5.5 mM (P less than 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations from 4.2 to 3.5 mM (P less than 0.001) in bezafibrate patients.
 There were no changes in serum lipid concentrations in the placebo group.
 Treatment of patients with moderately controlled NIDDM with bezafibrate improves glucose tolerance and the serum lipid profile.
 Bezafibrate treatment may be a useful adjunct to hypoglycemic therapy in patients with NIDDM.
