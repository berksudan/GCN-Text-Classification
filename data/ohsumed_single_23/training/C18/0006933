Treatment of severe reactive hypoglycemia with a somatostatin analogue (SMS 201-995).
 Reactive (or postprandial) hypoglycemia can sometimes represent a severe disorder refractory to conventional therapeutic measures.
 We present in this first individual trial, to our knowledge, that the administration of a somatostatin analogue (SMS 201-995) may alleviate the severity of complaints and does not appear to be diabetogenic.
 The effects of the somatostatin analogue were documented in a 5-hour oral glucose tolerance test, where not only the glucose-induced and C-peptide rise was clearly attenuated, but also the blood glucose concentration did not fall low enough to induce hypoglycemic symptoms.
