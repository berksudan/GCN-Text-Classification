Continuous glucose for treatment of patients with type 1 glycogen-storage disease: comparison of the effects of dextrose and uncooked cornstarch on biochemical variables.
 Responses to uncooked cornstarch (UCS), dextrose (Dex), and a 3:1 mixture (UCS:Dex) were determined in seven children with type 1 glycogen-storage disease (GSD-1).
 UCS maintained blood glucose (BG) and serum insulin concentrations between 3.5 +/- 0.3 and 4.0 +/- 0.4 mmol/L (mean +/- SEM) and 50 +/- 7 and 79 +/- 22 pmol/L, respectively, in six of the seven patients for 4 h.
 Only four of seven patients completed the 4-h test after UCS:Dex (BG 2.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/L): After Dex, tests had to be stopped in all patients by 150 min after initiation (BG 2.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/L).
 Two methods of providing dietary glucose overnight, continuous intragastric glucose infusion (COG) and intermittent UCS at 2100 and 0200, were compared by monitoring metabolites and glucoregulatory hormones.
 The use of UCS in amounts equal to the calculated glucose production rate is an effective method of providing a continuous dietary source of glucose overnight to patients with GSD-1.
