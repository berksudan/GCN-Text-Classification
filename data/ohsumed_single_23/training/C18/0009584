An implanted peritoneal oxygen tonometer that can be calibrated in situ.
 Oxygen tension in the peritoneum has been continuously measured with a Silastic tonometer having an integral oxygen electrode and inlet and outlet tubes for gasequilibrated electrolyte solution.
 Remote kinetic calibration of the system is periodically performed.
 Tonometers were implanted in six rabbits.
 Peritoneal oxygen tension was measured in awake and anesthetized rabbits under various oxygen breathing conditions.
