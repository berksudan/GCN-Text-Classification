Polymorphisms of HepG2/erythrocyte glucose-transporter gene. Linkage relationships and implications for genetic analysis of NIDDM.
 To assess the contribution of the HepG2/erythrocyte glucose-transporter (HepG2 GT) gene to the inherited susceptibility to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), cDNA and genomic probes were used to search for restriction-endonuclease polymorphisms at this locus.
 Analysis of DNA from 16 unrelated Black American individuals with 19 enzymes and as many as six different probes, defined four polymorphisms over a 45-kilobase region.
 Nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.006) was low relative to that at other loci, with an average of 1 in 1700 base pairs different between two chromosomes at this locus.
 The observed combined heterozygosity for these four sites was 0.69, which indicates that the markers at this locus could be useful for linkage analysis in families.
 Linkage-disequilibrium values between the four polymorphisms were evaluated by pairwise analysis and extended haplotypes.
 Calculating pairwise associations by the disequilibrium statistic delta or by another measure of disequilibrium, D' (the maximum likelihood of disequilibrium, which is less dependent on frequency), significant linkage disequilibrium could not be demonstrated.
 However, the frequencies of the observed extended haplotypes were shown to differ (chi 2 = 9.1, df = 2, P less than 0.025) from predicted frequencies if the sites were in linkage equilibrium in Blacks.
 The frequencies of these four polymorphisms were determined in Black nondiabetic (n = 44) and NIDDM (n = 63) subjects.
 Neither the allelic nor genotypic frequencies of the polymorphisms differed between the two groups.
