Urinary organic acid excretion during feeding of medium-chain or long-chain triglyceride diets in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are absorbed and metabolized differently from long-chain triglycerides (LCTs).
 Recent data indicate that MCTs may be useful as a dietary substitute in a variety of clinical disorders.
 The current studies were undertaken to characterize urinary organic acid excretion in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus during 4 d of an LCT or MCT diet.
 Urinary excretion of the dicarboxylic acids adipic, suberic, and 3-hydroxysebacic and the (omega-1) hydroxylation products 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid and 7-hydroxyoctanoic acid, was increased during MCT feeding as compared with LCT feeding.
 Urinary suberic and 7-hydroxyoctanoic acid excretions were increased 55- and 30-fold, respectively, during the MCT-substituted diet.
 Urinary organic acid profiles provide information on the fate of lipids during MCT feeding and may also be useful in assessing complicance during clinical trials employing MCT-substituted diets.
