HLA antigens and nailfold capillary microscopy studies in patients with insulin dependent and noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus and limited joint mobility.
 We investigated the HLA status of patients with diabetes associated with limited joint mobility and microvascular complications.
 An increased frequency of HLA-B8, DR3 and DR4 in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) compared to controls and patients with noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) was confirmed.
 HLA antigen DQw1 was detected less frequently in patients with IDDM and was negatively associated with limited joint mobility and retinopathy.
 Limited joint mobility was significantly correlated with disease duration in IDDM, and was associated with neuropathy in both IDDM and NIDDM and with retinopathy in IDDM.
 No correlation was found between DR3, DR4 and limited joint mobility or diabetic complications.
 We also investigated the usefulness of nailfold capillary microscopy in a large group of patients with IDDM and NIDDM.
 Although capillary enlargement and avascular areas were noted in a few patients, nailfold capillary microscopy was not felt to be a useful tool in the evaluation of diabetes.
