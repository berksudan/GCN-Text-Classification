Diet-induced hypercholesterolemia in mice: prevention by overexpression of LDL receptors.
 The current studies were designed to determine whether chronic overexpression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver would protect mice from the increase in plasma LDL-cholesterol that is induced by high-fat diets.
 A line of transgenic mice was studied that express the human LDL receptor gene in the liver under control of the transferrin promoter.
 When fed a diet containing cholesterol, saturated fat, and bile acids for 3 weeks, the transgenic mice, in contrast to normal mice, did not develop a detectable increase in plasma LDL.
 The current data indicate that unregulated overexpression of LDL receptors can protect against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia in mice.
