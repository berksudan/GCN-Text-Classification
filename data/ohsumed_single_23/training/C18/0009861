Serum lipoproteins, apolipoproteins and very low density lipoprotein subfractions during 6-month fibrate treatment in primary hypertriglyceridaemia.
 Serum lipoproteins and apolipoproteins were studied in 14 hypertriglyceridaemic (HTG) patients during a 24-week period of treatment with gemfibrozil, and after a 6-week washout period.
 A marked decrease in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglyceride was observed.
 There was an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, particularly the HDL3 component.
 A slight increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was observed after 12 weeks, but this had almost disappeared after 24 weeks.
 The treatment resulted in an increase in serum apolipoprotein A-II levels and a reduction in serum apo C-III and apo E.
 VLDL subfractionation by density gradient centrifugation in four subfractions of decreasing size (A, B, C and D) showed a predominant reduction of the large subfractions A, B and C, while the decrease in VLDL-D was less marked.
 Percentage changes from the baseline level of VLDL-A and VLDL-D cholesterol were found to be inversely correlated with percentage changes in HDL and LDL cholesterol, respectively.
 This might reflect a transfer of cholesterol from VLDL-A to HDL, and from VLDL-D to LDL.
 The above data suggest fibrate-induced stimulation of lipoprotein lipase, and indicate that the enhanced transfer of cholesterol from VLDL to LDL, induced by fibrates in HTG patients, is less pronounced after a prolonged period of treatment.
