Reduced beta-cell glucose transporter in new onset diabetic BB rats.
 Previous studies from our laboratories have suggested a defect in glucose transport in islets isolated from BB rats on the first day of overt diabetes.
 To quantitate by immunostaining the glucose transporter of beta-cells (GLUT-2) before and at the onset of autoimmune diabetes we employed an antibody to its COOH-terminal octapeptide.
 On the first day of overt diabetes, defined as the day the daily blood glucose first reached 200 mg/dl, the volume density ratio of GLUT-2-positive to insulin-positive beta-cells was only 0.48 +/- 0.06, compared to 0.91 +/- 0.02 in age-matched nondiabetic diabetes-resistant controls (P less than 0.001).
 In age-matched nondiabetic diabetes-prone rats, most of which would have become diabetic, the ratio was 0.85 +/- 0.02, also less than the controls (P less than 0.05).
 Protein A-gold labeling of GLUT-2 in beta-cells of day 1 diabetic rats revealed 2.17 +/- 0.16 gold particles per micrometer length of microvillar plasma membranes compared to 3.91 +/- 0.14 in controls (P less than 0.001) and 2.87 +/- 0.24 in the nondiabetic diabetes-prone rats (P less than 0.02).
 Reduction in GLUT-2 correlates temporally with and may contribute to the loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that precedes profound beta-cell depletion of autoimmune diabetes.
