Pursuing mild elevations of liver enzyme values to exclude hemochromatosis.
 To determine whether physicians in an academic medical center excluded hemochromatosis as a diagnosis in a population of patients with mildly elevated liver enzyme values, we reviewed 100 charts of patients with both aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels that were less than twice the upper limit of normal.
 We analyzed each chart to determine if hemochromatosis would have been excluded by a subsequent workup.
 Those patients who did not have a complete workup were assigned to one of three categories: (1) no mention was made of abnormal liver enzyme values; (2) liver enzyme values were ascribed to some condition other then hemochromatosis and no definitive workup was done; and (3) the condition of the patient was so poor that assessment did not seem indicated.
 Ninety of 100 patients were not given a workup to exclude hemochromatosis.
 Physicians often ignore mild elevations in liver enzyme values.
