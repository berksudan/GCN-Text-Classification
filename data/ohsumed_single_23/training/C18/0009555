An efficient method for removing bilirubin.
 Bilirubin is tightly bound to albumin, making hemoperfusion an ineffective treatment for hyperbilirubinemia.
 By adding a safe unbinding agent to the blood (solutizer), which itself is adsorbed, hemoperfusion can become efficient and practical.
 Canines were made hyperbilirubinemic with an intravenous infusion of a 5 mg/ml solution (with Na2CO3) for 1 hour.
 Peak concentrations of 14-22 mg/dl were reached in adult dogs (25-35 kg).
 Hemoperfusion was then initiated with or without (control) the solutizer (sodium benzoate).
 The bilirubin unbinding effect of sodium benzoate was rapid and effective.
 Because of the simultaneous adsorption of sodium benzoate, a small activated carbon section that was presaturated with the solutizer was located proximal to the main hemoperfusion column, in addition to continuous infusion to reach 20 mM in the blood.
 Comparison of the normalized bilirubin concentration for benzoate augmented hemoperfusion with the average for control dogs, shows that benzoate results in a threefold decrease in the normalized bilirubin concentration after 1.5 hr of hemoperfusion.
 Sodium benzoate may also have the advantage of protecting platelets during hemoperfusion.
