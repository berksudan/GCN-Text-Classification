Hyponatremia in rats induces downregulation of vasopressin synthesis.
 Hyponatremia due to inappropriate secretion of vasopressin is a common disorder in human pathophysiology, but vasopressin synthesis during hypoosmolality has not been investigated.
 We used a new method to quantitate synthesis of vasopressin in rats after 3, 7, and 14 d of hyponatremia induced by administering dDAVP (a vasopressin agonist) and a liquid diet.
 Vasopressin synthesis was completely turned off by 7 d.
 Vasopressin mRNA levels in the hypothalamus paralleled the reduction in synthesis and were reduced to levels of only 10-15% of the content in control rats.
 When hyponatremia was corrected by withdrawal of dDAVP, vasopressin mRNA slowly returned to normal over 7 d.
 The observation that vasopressin synthesis can be so completely turned off leads to several conclusions: under normal physiological conditions the neurohypophysis is chronically upregulated; there must be an osmotic threshold for initiation of vasopressin synthesis (and release); the large store of hormone in the posterior pituitary is essential for vasopressin to be available during times of decreased synthesis; and, finally, some nonosmolar stimulus for synthesis must be present during clinical disorders when vasopressin is secreted (and synthesized) despite hypoosmolality.
