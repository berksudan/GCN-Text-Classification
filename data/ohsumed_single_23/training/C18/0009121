Morbidly obese patients' perceptions of social discrimination before and after surgery for obesity.
 Morbidly obese patients' perceptions of obesity-related prejudice and discrimination were assessed before and 14 months after operation for obesity.
 Preoperatively, the 57 consecutive patients perceived overwhelming prejudice and discrimination at work, within the family, and in public places.
 After a weight loss of more than 45.5 kg (100 lb), these patients perceived little or no prejudice or discrimination.
 We examine factors contributing to the change in patients' perceptions and comment upon patients' perceptions of the negative attitudes held by health professionals toward obese patients.
