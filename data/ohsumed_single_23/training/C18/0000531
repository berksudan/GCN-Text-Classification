Absence of brown product FFI in nondiabetic and diabetic rat collagen.
 Accumulation of brown products in long-lived proteins might be an important factor in determining long-term diabetic complications.
 Fluorescent chromophore 2-(2-furoyl)-4-(5)-(2-furanyl)-1H-imidazole (FFI), isolated from hydrolyzed brown products synthesized in vitro, was proposed as a specific brown product responsible for functional and structural changes in long-lived proteins.
 In this study, an attempt was made to demonstrate by means of collision spectroscopy the presence of FFI in collagen samples taken from diabetic rats.
 Diabetic rat collagen samples showed mean values of absorbance per milligram of 4-hydroxy-L-proline significantly higher than those observed in nondiabetic rats, suggesting higher FFI levels.
 Surprisingly, all collagen samples from diabetic and nondiabetic rats gave collision spectra in which no peak diagnostic of FFI presence was observed.
 These data suggest that the absorbance level observed in diabetic rats is not due to the presence of FFI but to structurally related compounds, which are being investigated by means of mass spectrometry.
