Hypokalemic and ECG sequelae of combined beta-agonist/diuretic therapy. Protection by conventional doses of spironolactone but not triamterene.
 Salbutamol (Albuterol) and diuretics are commonly prescribed together in patients with airflow obstruction and are associated with electrocardiographic effects.
 We have now investigated whether the use of potassium-sparing drugs might prevent the ECG sequelae of such combined therapy.
 Ten healthy subjects received seven days of randomized treatments with: placebo, bendrofluazide (5 mg), bendrofluazide plus triamterene 50 mg (conventional dose), or triamterene 200 mg (high dose), and bendrofluazide plus spironolactone (100 mg).
 Potassium and ECG responses to inhaled salbutamol, 2 mg, were measured after each treatment period.
 The T-wave flattening in response to bendrofluazide and salbutamol (0.24[CI, 0.19 to 0.29]mV) was attenuated by the addition of triamterene, 200 mg (0.33[CI, 0.28 to 0.37]mV; p less than 0.05) and spironolactone 100 mg (0.42[CI, 0.37 to 0.47]mV; p less than 0.01), but not by triamterene 50 mg (0.25[CI, 0.20 to 0.30]mV).
 Spironolactone and high dose triamterene also diminished the frequency of U waves and ST depression.
 The ECG effects mirrored hypokalemic responses which were also blunted by high dose (p less than 0.01) but not low dose triamterene, as well as by spironolactone (p less than 0.001).
 Thus, the use of high dose triamterene and spironolactone protected against the hypokalemic and ECG sequelae of combined beta-agonist/diuretic therapy, whereas a conventional dose of triamterene had no effect.
 These findings may be important in the prevention of a potentially dangerous interaction in susceptible patients taking this combination of drugs.
