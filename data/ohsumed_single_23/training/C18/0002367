Serial evaluation of lipid profiles and risk factors for development of hyperlipidemia after cardiac transplantation.
 To determine the prevalence, time course and factors responsible for hyperlipidemia after heart transplantation, 83 consecutive 1-year survivors were studied.
 By 1 year, 83% of patients had serum total cholesterol levels greater than 5.2 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) and 28% of the patients had serum total cholesterol higher than the age- and sex-matched ninety-fifth percentile.
 At the end of 1-year follow-up, serum total cholesterol correlated with the recipient age (p less than 0.0001), the preoperative cholesterol level (p less than 0.001), the actual dose of maintenance prednisone at 1 year (p less than 0.02) and the cumulative 1-year steroid dose (p less than 0.03).
 Similarly, the serum triglyceride level at 1 year correlated with the pretransplant level of serum triglycerides (p less than 0.0001), recipient age (p less than 0.03) and cumulative 1-year steroid dose (p less than 0.03).
 Patients with a pretransplant diagnosis of coronary artery disease had a significantly higher level of serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels at 1 year (p less than 0.02 and p less than 0.03, respectively).
 Heart transplant recipients with body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2 also presented with significantly elevated serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels at 1 year compared with nonobese patients (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.002, respectively).
 Hyperlipidemia occurs frequently and is detected within the first month after heart transplantation.
 Optimal management of this problem requires further study.
