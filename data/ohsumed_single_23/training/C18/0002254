The changing epidemiology of diabetes mellitus among Navajo Indians.
 Although early descriptions of diabetes mellitus among Navajo Indians characterized the disease as an infrequent and "benign chemical abnormality," the prevalence of diabetes and its complications among Navajos appears to have increased substantially in this century.
 We reviewed recent Indian Health Service inpatient and ambulatory care data and compared these data with previous reports.
 Of the estimated Navajo population aged 45 years or older, 4,331 (16.9%) had an ambulatory care visit for diabetes between October 1, 1986, and September 30, 1987.
 Diabetes was coded for 1,041 (7.0%) of hospital admissions of persons aged 20 and older.
 Of 377 lower-extremity amputations done from 1978 to 1987, diabetes was involved in 245 (66%).
 The 1986 age-adjusted mortality rate from diabetes was 30.3 per 100,000, approximately twice that for the general US population.
 The explanation for the increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus among Navajos probably relates to an increasing prevalence of obesity.
