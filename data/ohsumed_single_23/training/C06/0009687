Cigarette smoking, gastric acidity and peptic ulceration. What are the relationships?
 The influence of cigarette smoking on intragastric acidity was assessed in duodenal ulcer patients in symptomatic remission and in healthy volunteers in a retrospective study.
 Continuous 24-hr pH recordings in 150 nonsmokers and 174 smokers receiving placebo treatment were compared.
 Daytime intragastric acidity was higher in smokers with a median pH (interquartile range) of 1.56 (1.34-1.80) than in nonsmokers, who had a median pH of 1.70 (1.45-1.97) (P less than 0.001).
 There was no difference in 24-hr and nighttime median pH between the two groups.
 The small difference in daytime intragastric acidity in smokers and nonsmokers is unlikely to account for the increased prevalence of peptic ulcer disease in smokers.
 The analysis of smoking status in duodenal ulcer patients and healthy controls and males and females supports the general trend towards higher daytime acidity in smokers.
 Again, no differences in pH during the 24-hr or night period were found between the groups.
 The epidemiological and clinical correlation between smoking and duodenal ulcer disease is not adequately explained by increased intragastric acidity.
