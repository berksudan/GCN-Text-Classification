Mallory-Weiss syndrome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
 We report hematemesis from Mallory-Weiss tears after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
 A computer search of the English language literature disclosed only 3 similar cases, and we review them.
 This complication of CPR may occur more frequently than recognized and should be prevented by careful technique.
