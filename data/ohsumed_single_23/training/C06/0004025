Schatzki's ring: long-term results following dilation 
 The purpose of this study is to report long-term results of 61 patients with Schatzki's ring who were dilated for relief of dysphagia.
 The severity of Schatzki's ring was mild in 28 patients (46%), moderate in 26 (43%), severe in 5 (8%), and indeterminate in 2 (3%).
 Follow-up information was available in 56 of 61 patients (mean, 75 months).
 During follow-up, 35 patients (63%) developed recurrent dysphagia and required repeated dilations: 19 patients (34%) had one to two dilations, 9 patients (16%) had three to seven dilations, 6 patients (11%) had more than seven dilations; 1 patient underwent surgery for resection of the Schatzki's ring (2%).
 The mean (range) dilation-free interval was 50.1 months (11.8 to 100 months) in mild cases, 44.5 months (8.9 to 82 months) in moderate cases, and 28.6 months (9 to 76 months) in severe cases.
 There was no significant correlation between the severity of Schatzki's ring on initial presentation and the subsequent dilation-free interval.
 Our data indicate that recurrent dysphagia is common among patients with Schatzki's ring after a successful dilation, and that the severity of Schatzki's ring is not a good prognostic indicator of the need for subsequent dilation.
