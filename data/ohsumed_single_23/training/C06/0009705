Relation of Helicobacter pylori to the human gastric mucosa in chronic gastritis of the antrum.
 The spatial relations between bacteria and the affected tissues can indicate pathogenic mechanisms.
 This study was undertaken to define the spatial relation of Helicobacter pylori to the human gastric mucosa.
 Antibodies against gastric mucus and ruthenium red were used to stabilise the glycoprotein structure of the mucus and glycocalyces in antral biopsy specimens from eight patients infected with H pylori.
 The location of organisms and ultrastructural features were assessed using systematic scanning and transmission electron microscopy: 92 (2)% (mean (SE] of H pylori were in the pit mucus, and 7 (3)% were in the surface mucus; 60 (12)% of H pylori were close to epithelial cells, with only 5 (2)% located near the epithelial intercellular junctions.
 Fine filamentous strands extended between organisms and nearby epithelial cells, with few organisms in membrane to membrane contact.
 H pylori were not observed between, beneath, or within cells of the gastric mucosa.
 The preferred location of H pylori in the gastric antrum is within the pit mucus close to the epithelial cell surface, with no evidence that they have a direct toxic effect on the mucosa.
