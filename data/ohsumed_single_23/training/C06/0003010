Acalculus lymphoeosinophilic cholecystitis associated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy.
 A case of unusual cholecystitis that developed on completion of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy is described.
 A 62-year-old man was treated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells for disseminated renal cell carcinoma.
 During the course of the immunotherapy, his serum alkaline phosphatase level increased, as did the peripheral eosinophil count (0.31).
 Subsequently, clinical and radiologic evidence of acute cholecystitis was noted.
 The removed gallbladder showed acalculus cholecystitis with extensive diffuse infiltrates of numerous eosinophils and T lymphocytes, but sparse polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
 The authors name this unusual cholecystitis acalculus lymphoeosinophilic cholecystitis and believe it to be associated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy.
 The pathogenic relationship is discussed.
