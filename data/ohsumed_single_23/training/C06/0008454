Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for biliary stones.
 Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is a noninvasive technique for treatment of patients with gallbladder and bile duct stones.
 Selected patients with gallbladder stones can be treated on an outpatient basis without general anesthesia and may return to full activity within 1 or 2 days.
 Stone-free rates of 40% to 60% at 6 months have been achieved in most reported series with minimal morbidity.
 Bile duct stone lithotripsy has achieved stone clearance in 80% of patients in whom conventional methods were unsuccessful and therefore constitutes a valuable second-line treatment for these patients.
