Advanced assessment of the abdomen and gastrointestinal problems.
 There are many unique physical assessment findings that are associated with specific gastrointestinal disorders.
 The detection of these findings enables the nurse to manage gastrointestinal emergencies on the patient unit in a timely fashion, preventing deterioration and maintaining the safety of the patient.
 These skills build well on the traditional, detailed, and comprehensive assessments the nurse makes when using the nursing process.
 Specific abdominal assessments include detection of signs associated with appendicitis such as rebound tenderness and McBurney's, Rosvig's, and Aaron's signs.
 The nurse must always be alert to the possibility of peritonitis and the urgency of early detection and treatment.
 The patient with cirrhosis of the liver presents a distinct clinical picture.
 There is a need for subtle evaluation of mental status to detect early signs of hepatic coma.
 Another extra-abdominal assessment of this complication is asterixis.
 Finally, the assessment of the patient is enhanced when the nurse is able to help identify the location of bleeding.
 Improving abdominal and gastrointestinal system assessment leads to early detection of nursing problems and appropriate interventions.
