Increasing prevalence of gallstones in male veterans with alcoholic cirrhosis.
 Cases of alcoholic cirrhosis identified at necropsy were studied for the prevalence and type of gallstones, compared with age- and race-matched autopsy controls.
 Data were examined from 1970-1977 and 1980-1987.
 In the early sample of 460 cirrhotic patients, 33% had gallstone disease, contrasted with 12% in the controls.
 In the 1980s, among 299 patients, 46% had gallstone disease, whereas it was present in 13% of the controls.
 The prevalence of stones was significantly greater in the patients than in the controls for both time periods and, among the patients, was significantly greater in the 1980s than in the 1970s (p less than 0.05).
 A comparison of cirrhotic patients with and without gallstones indicated a significantly higher incidence of ascites in the patients with gallstones.
 The gallstones in cirrhotics were more frequently pigmented than in the controls in both time periods.
 In 100 living patients with advanced cirrhosis studied by sonography during 1987 and 1989, the prevalence of gallstones was 43%, almost the same as the autopsy sample from 1980-1987.
 In these cirrhotics, ascites, encephalopathy, and varices were more prevalent in the patients with stones than those without.
 We conclude that pigmented gallstones are increasing in cirrhosis of the liver related to the severity of the liver disease.
