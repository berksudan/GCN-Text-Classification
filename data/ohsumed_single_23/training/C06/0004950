Azathioprine in the treatment of children with inflammatory bowel disease.
 During a 6-year period, we treated 21 patients with azathioprine, 2 mg/kg/day, as an adjunct to their customary regimen.
 Nine patients had ulcerative colitis and 12 patients had Crohn disease; the patients' ages ranged from 3 to 17 years.
 The median duration of disease before the start of azathioprine therapy was 2 years, and median follow-up was 2 years.
 Sixteen patients seemed to respond to azathioprine therapy: six patients in each disease group had complete responses and four patients (one with ulcerative colitis and three with Crohn disease) had partial responses.
 Two patients with ulcerative colitis and three patients with Crohn disease did not respond.
 The median time until patients responded was less than 3 months for patients with ulcerative colitis and 4 months for those with Crohn disease.
 Reduction of corticosteroid dose was possible for all patients who responded to azathioprine therapy.
 Only minimal side effects were attributable to the drug.
 We conclude that azathioprine is an effective adjunctive agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in childhood, but because questions remain regarding its long-term safety, its use should be reserved for children with refractory disease or severe and unacceptable side effects of corticosteroids.
