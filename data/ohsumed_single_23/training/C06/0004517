Crohn's disease: what about the pancreas? [editorial]
 Crohn's disease (CD) is now accepted as a systemic illness.
 The importance of extraintestinal manifestations is underlined by the fact that such "complications" can be more prominent and even more difficult to control than the intestinal disease itself.
 Lately, evidence for a more than accidental association of pancreatitis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with CD is growing.
 This might have a significant impact on the treatment of abdominal pain and diarrhea in CD, symptoms which have so far been attributed exclusively to the intestinal rather than the extraintestinal manifestations of the disease.
