From Leningrad to the day-care center. The ubiquitous Giardia lamblia.
 Giardiasis is recognized as a worldwide public health problem.
 Seroprevalence data from both the developing and developed world show high rates of carriage in populations at risk for fecal-oral transmission, such as children in day-care centers.
 Outbreak investigation has expanded our understanding of reservoirs for Giardia lamblia and of the routes of transmission.
 Various host factors have been associated with infection.
 The pathogenesis of giardial infections is being elucidated, in particular the role of lectin activation in producing disease.
 Three standard chemotherapeutic agents are available in the United States.
 The institution of community-wide prevention measures is equally important.
 Current areas of investigation including antigenic composition and enzymatic variants should result in effective forms of immunotherapy, while more effective forms of chemoprophylaxis could assist in eradicating the pathogen from institutional settings.
