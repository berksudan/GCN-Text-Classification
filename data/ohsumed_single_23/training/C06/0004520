Stasis syndromes following gastric surgery: clinical and motility features of 60 symptomatic patients.
 We retrospectively reviewed the records of 60 patients who had been referred for gastrointestinal manometry because of stasis after gastric surgery.
 Nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, and weight loss were the most common symptoms.
 Two thirds of these patients had a well-documented history of peptic ulcer before their initial operations; in others, surgery was performed for other reasons, such as obesity (5%) or reflux esophagitis (8%).
 Twelve patients had undergone truncal vagotomy and a "drainage operation" and 48 had received a partial gastrectomy with a gastroenterostomy: Billroth I (n = 8), Billroth II (n = 11), Roux-en-Y (n = 29).
 All patients had recordings of gastrointestinal manometry; 16 also had a scintigraphic measurement of gastric emptying.
 Measurements were compared with data from healthy controls.
 Gastric manometry, which could be assessed only in the group with an intact antrum, was characterized by antral hypomotility (p less than 0.05).
 Gastric emptying studies showed rapid early emptying of liquids and delayed emptying of solids (both p less than 0.05).
 In the whole group, fasting jejunal motility was characterized by absence of phase II in 13, presence of bursts of phasic activity in 18, and abnormal propagation of phase III in 8.
 A significantly increased frequency of phase III of MMC was noted in the patients after Billroth II and Roux-en-Y operations.
 Postprandially, 19 patients failed to develop a "fed pattern.".
