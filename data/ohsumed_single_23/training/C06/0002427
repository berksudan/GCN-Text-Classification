Healing or amelioration of esophagitis does not result in increased lower esophageal sphincter or esophageal contractile pressure [published erratum appears in Am J Gastroenterol 1991 Feb;86(2):253]
 There is conflicting evidence regarding whether lower esophageal sphincter and esophageal contractile pressures are affected by changes in the severity of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 We compared the manometric and endoscopic findings from 30 patients before and after treatment for esophagitis.
 Before treatment, the grade of esophagitis (I-III) was significantly correlated (r = -0.37; p less than 0.05) with lower esophageal sphincter pressure, but not with esophageal contractile pressure.
 After treatment, the grade of esophagitis did not change or became worse in 15 patients, and became better in 15 patients.
 Of these, seven healed.
 The group that showed no endoscopic improvement demonstrated no change in lower esophageal sphincter or esophageal contractile pressures.
 The group that did show endoscopic improvement also demonstrated no increase in lower esophageal sphincter or esophageal contractile pressures, and this was particularly evident in those whose esophagitis healed.
 These data suggest that healing of esophagitis does not result in improvement of esophageal motor function.
