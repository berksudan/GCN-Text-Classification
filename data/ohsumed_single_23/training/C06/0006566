Outpatient laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy.
 Laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy has been performed clinically in the United States since 1988.
 After refinement of the technique, the procedure was offered on an outpatient basis.
 Eighty-three patients underwent laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy during the study period.
 Thirty-seven (45%) had the procedure as an outpatient.
 Younger patients were more suited for the outpatient procedure and those without previous surgery were more likely to have the procedure done as an outpatient.
 Weight, operating time, and gallbladder pathology were similar, although patients with acute inflammation of the gallbladder were more likely to require hospitalization.
 The primary reason for patient admission was patient preference.
