Effect of race upon organ donation and recipient survival in liver transplantation.
 The effect of the race of the donor on organ donation and on the outcome of clinical liver transplantation has not been addressed previously.
 The aims of this study were to determine: (1) the number of organs donated by each of the major racial groups of the United States, (2) the outcome of transplantation of these organs across racial groups, and (3) the pattern of liver disease that required transplantation in each of these racial groups.
 A significantly higher proportion of organs were donated by white non-Hispanic Americans than either black or Hispanic Americans.
 There was no significant difference in survival when an organ was transplanted between black and white Americans and vice versa.
 Postnecrotic cirrhosis from a variety of causes was the most common indicator affecting black and white recipients, while primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis were uncommon in the black population.
 While the number of organs donated by blacks was low, it was, however, proportional to the number of black recipients in this study.
 Reasons for the low rate of donation by the black and white Hispanic population are discussed.
 It is concluded that race is not a criteria to be used in selection of donors for liver transplantation.
 Educational programs addressing issues of organ donation and transplantation directed towards the black and Hispanic populations are recommended.
