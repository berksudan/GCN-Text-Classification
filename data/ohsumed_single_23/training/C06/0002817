CT diagnosis of acquired small bowel volvulus.
 Small-bowel volvulus is an uncommon but important cause of small-bowel obstruction and often results in ischemia or infarction.
 Clinical examination and plain film radiography may be nondiagnostic, leading to delay in surgical intervention with subsequent increase in morbidity and mortality.
 We present two patients in whom the diagnosis of strangulating small-bowel volvulus was made by computed tomography (CT), allowing rapid surgical correction of this potentially life-threatening condition.
