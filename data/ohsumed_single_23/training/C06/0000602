Mechanical lithotripsy of common duct stones.
 Over the past 8 years we have utilized various types of mechanical lithotriptors to crush common bile duct stones.
 The procedure was performed in 93 patients with an overall success rate of 94%.
 However, because many accessories were in a developmental stage, entrapment of stones was not always possible on the first attempt, and the procedure was repeated in some patients a second or third time.
 During the interim, while awaiting another attempt at lithotripsy, cholangitis was prevented by leaving a prosthesis in place.
 A variety of lithotriptor models from different manufacturers have proven effective.
 We recommend that endoscopists use these devices to rid the bile duct of retained stones.
