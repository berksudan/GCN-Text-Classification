Early results of combined electrohydraulic shock-wave lithotripsy and oral litholytic therapy of gallbladder stones at the University of Iowa.
 One hundred thirty-three patients were entered into a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy for symptomatic gallstones versus extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy plus adjuvant litholytic therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).
 Six months after lithotripsy, patients receiving placebo were crossed over to UDCA therapy without unblinding the study.
 One hundred sixteen patients have completed 6 months of follow-up.
 Five patients were dropped from the study.
 Nine percent have required cholecystectomy (11 patients with biliary colic and 1 with acute cholecystitis).
 Ninety-one patients had a solitary stone (64 patients had stones less than or equal to 20 mm and 27 patients had stones greater than 20 mm in diameter), and 25 patients had two to three stones.
 Fifty percent were retreated.
 Cumulative stone-free rates at 6, 12, and 18 months were 26%, 39%, and 41%, respectively.
 At 6 months there was a significant advantage for patients treated with UDCA versus placebo (36% vs 17% were stone free) that had disappeared by 12 months (placebo-treated patients had received 6 months of UDCA).
 Patients with solitary stones equal to or less than 20 mm in diameter treated with UDCA had stone-free rates at 6, 12, and 18 months of 58%, 58%, and 62%, respectively, versus 27%, 56%, and 50%.
 The difference was significant only at the 6- month follow-up.
 Stone-free rates for patients with large solitary stones and multiple stones were very low.
 Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is both safe and effective therapy for treatment of symptomatic gallstones in patients with a solitary stone equal to or less than 20 mm in diameter.
 UDCA markedly improves the efficiency of the procedure and results in a stone-free gallbladder sooner.
