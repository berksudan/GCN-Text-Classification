Collis gastroplasty: origin and evolution.
 In 1957 J.
 Leigh Collis published his innovative operation for treating the difficult problem of the irreducible hiatal hernia, esophagitis, and stricture.
 The design of the operation was based on the relatively primitive understanding of hiatal hernia and the newly emerging concept of reflux esophagitis.
 A variety of antireflux operations by different surgeons emerged over the years to follow.
 The original Collis gastroplasty has been subsequently modified with the addition of both partial and complete fundoplication procedures.
 The place of the modified Collis gastroplasty-fundoplication operations in today's approach to the problems of hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease remains unsettled.
