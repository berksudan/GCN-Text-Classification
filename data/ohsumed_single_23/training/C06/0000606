Can clinicians accurately assess esophageal dilation without fluoroscopy?
 This study questioned whether clinicians could determine the success of esophageal dilation accurately without the aid of fluoroscopy.
 Twenty patients were enrolled with the diagnosis of distal esophageal stenosis, including benign peptic stricture (17), Schatski's ring (2), and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (1).
 Dilation attempts using only Maloney dilators were monitored fluoroscopically by the principle investigator, the physician and patient being unaware of the findings.
 Physicians then predicted whether or not their dilations were successful, and they examined various features to determine their usefulness in predicting successful dilation.
 They were able to predict successful dilation accurately in 97% of the cases studied; however, their predictions of unsuccessful dilation were correct only 60% of the time.
 Features helpful in predicting passage included easy passage of the dilator (98%) and the patient feeling the dilator in the stomach (95%).
 Excessive resistance suggesting unsuccessful passage was an unreliable feature and was often due to the dilator curling in the stomach.
 When Maloney dilators are used to dilate simple distal strictures, if the physician predicts successful passage, he is reliably accurate without the use of fluoroscopy; however, if unsuccessful passage is suspected, fluoroscopy must be used for confirmation.
