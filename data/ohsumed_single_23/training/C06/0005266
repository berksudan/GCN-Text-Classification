Preliminary report: the antegrade continence enema.
 The principles of antegrade colonic washout and the Mitrofanoff non-refluxing catheterisable channel were combined to produce a continent catheterisable colonic stoma.
 The intention was that antegrade washouts delivered by this route would produce complete colonic emptying and thereby prevent soiling.
 The procedure has been successfully carried out in five patients with intractable faecal incontinence.
