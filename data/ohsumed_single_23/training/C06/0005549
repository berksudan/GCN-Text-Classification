Cyclic pelvic pain.
 Cyclic pelvic pain is a common gynecologic problem caused by relatively few diseases, which usually can be diagnosed and remedied quickly.
 Some complaints reflect normal physiologic aspects of the menstrual cycle (mittelschmerz, menstrual awareness).
 Premenstrual syndrome can be diagnosed, but an effective and convenient treatment is lacking.
 Dysmenorrhea is the commonest source of cyclic pain, diagnosed by its characteristic history and rapid relief on administration of antiprostaglandin agents.
 Endometriosis is diagnosed surgically and best treated either surgically then, or medically by danazol or GnRH agonists.
 In contrast, adenomyosis is a problem commonly encountered in later life, and hysterectomy is usually needed for both definitive diagnosis and treatment.
