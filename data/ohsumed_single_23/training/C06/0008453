Gallstone dissolution.
 Many methods are available for gallstone dissolution, including oral bile salts; cholesterol solvents such as mono-octanoin or methyl tert-butyl either; and calcium or pigment solvents such as EDTA and polysorbate.
 Which of these approaches will be appropriate for an individual patient depends on the type of stones; whether they are in the gallbladder or the bile ducts; whether access to the biliary tree is available; the patient's age and general medical condition; and the availability of necessary expertise.
 In the US, both chenodeoxycholate and ursodeoxycholate are now available.
 Ursodeoxycholate is more expensive but appears to produce fewer side effects and may be more efficacious.
 These agents are most effective in thin women with small floating, radiolucent cholesterol stones in a functioning gallbladder.
 Only about half of the small subset of patients will experience partial or complete dissolution of stones within a year.
 Stone recurrence and the potential toxicity of long-term therapy are problems with this approach.
 Therefore, for most patients, cholecystectomy, either in the traditional fashion or using a laparoscopic approach (see article later in this issue by Gadacz et al), is the most cost-effective and perhaps the safest option.
 Intragallbladder instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether probably will be applicable only to a small subset of patients, and treatment is likely to be followed by a high recurrence rate.
 In patients with retained common duct cholesterol stones and access to the biliary tree, mono-octanoin therapy is advantageous in that it can be initiated as soon as cholangiography demonstrates no extravasation.
 In properly selected patients, a 90% success rate with this technique can be expected within 7 days.
