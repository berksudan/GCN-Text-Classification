Esophageal motility in an adult with a congenital H-type tracheoesophageal fistula.
 Congenital H-type tracheoesophageal fistulas (TEF) are rare.
 Long-standing respiratory symptoms are the most common presenting complaints.
 Patients with these fistulas have a congenital esophageal motor abnormality characterized by uncoordinated, low-amplitude peristalsis of the esophageal body; both low and normal lower esophageal sphincter pressures have been described.
 These findings persist despite fistula repair.
 A case history of an adult patient with congenital TEF is presented and the literature is reviewed.
 This patient is unusual in that esophageal symptoms (dysphagia) were more prominent than the usual respiratory symptoms.
