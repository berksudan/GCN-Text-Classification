Bile duct emptying in response to fat: a validation study.
 Fatty meal sonography has been suggested to assess patients with biliary pain after cholecystectomy, but the effects of gallbladder removal on biliary dynamics has not been studied prospectively.
 Before elective cholecystectomy, 25 patients had their common hepatic ducts' diameter measured by ultrasonography before and after a fat stimulus.
 In 23, tests were repeated 1 month, 1 year, and 5 years after surgery.
 In preoperative studies, 5 patients showed dilatation after fat and 2 of these had stones in the common bile duct.
 However, another 4 patients with stones or sludge in the duct did not show dilatation, so that the response to fat was a poor indicator of patients requiring common bile duct exploration.
 No patient had major symptoms after surgery.
 At 1 month and 12 months, the response to fat was variable with more than half of those tested showing no decrease in duct size.
 A more consistent pattern emerged at 5 years, when 14 of 18 patients tested showed a decrease in common hepatic duct after fat; 3 were unchanged and 1 increased by 1 mm.
 The response to fat was less consistent and more difficult to measure in the common bile duct, even 5 years after operation.
 It was concluded that not all patients with indications for exploration of the common bile duct on operative cholangiography show a dilatation response to fat on preoperative testing.
 Also, fatty meal sonography should be used with caution because the response to fat in asymptomatic patients soon after operation is unpredictable, with occasional patients showing dilation without apparent obstruction.
 Measurement of common hepatic duct is preferred to common bile duct and increases in diameter of 1 mm are probably not significant.
