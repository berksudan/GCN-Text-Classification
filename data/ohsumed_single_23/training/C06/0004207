Left retroperitoneal exposure for distal mesenteric artery repair.
 Distal disease in the mesenteric arteries has usually been repaired transabdominally since it is believed that only the proximal centimeter of each vessel is accessible through the retroperitoneum.
 We treated five patients with chronic visceral ischemia and lesions extending beyond the orifice using a retroperitoneal approach.
 Exposure was obtained with a left flank incision through the tenth interspace.
 The left crus of the diaphragm was divided in order to control the supraceliac aorta.
 The mesenteric vessels were identified and dissected until their entrance into the peritoneum.
 There were no difficulties in exposing the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) as it coursed under the pancreas and over the duodenum for an approximate length of 5 to 10 cm.
 The uncinate process of the pancreas was not a limiting factor for exposure of the SMA in this region and further distal exposure could be obtained by incising the peritoneum.
 The trifurcation of the celiac artery and the splenic artery were accessible through this exposure; however, only the first centimeter of the hepatic and gastric branches could be reached.
 Revascularization was performed with endarterectomy (2 patients) and bypass (3 patients).
 Bowel viability was assessed at the conclusion of the procedure by incising the peritoneum.
 There were no complications from this exposure and no patient required reoperation for ischemic bowel.
 We conclude that the left retroperitoneal approach is not only acceptable for orifice lesions but is also applicable for distal disease.
