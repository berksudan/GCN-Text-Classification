Ureteric substitution with Boari bladder flap.
 Between 1986 and 1989, 12 patients underwent ureteric substitution with a Boari bladder flap at this Institute.
 The indications were ureteric injury following hysterectomy, difficult forceps delivery, difficult ureterolithotomy, ureteric strictures caused by a Dormia basket and previous ureteric surgery, tuberculosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis and a post-ureteric reimplantation fistula.
 There were 2 patients with a solitary kidney and 2 in acute renal failure.
 Double J stenting was carried out in 11 patients and the stent was removed 3 to 6 weeks post-operatively.
 Good results, with no morbidity or mortality, were achieved in all but 1 patient where a simple Silastic stent had migrated to the pelvis and required open surgery to remove it.
 We attribute our success to the tension-free anastomosis, a wide based posterior flap with preservation of its vascular supply, the use of a double J stent and vicryl suture material.
