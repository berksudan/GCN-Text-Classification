Pediatric penetrating head and neck trauma.
 Penetrating head and neck trauma in children causes uncommon and potentially life-threatening injuries.
 We reviewed the charts of 21 patients who sustained penetrating injuries to the face or upper neck.
 Seventeen males and 4 females, aged 32 weeks' gestation to 19 years (mean = 10.2 years) comprised the study population.
 There were 15 gun-shot wounds, 1 shotgun injury, and 5 stab wounds.
 Significant problems included 7 vascular injuries, 6 central nervous system injuries, 5 ocular injuries, 3 airway compromises, 2 facial nerve injuries, 1 cervical esophageal penetration, and 2 cases of pneumothorax.
 Three deaths occurred, but the majority of the patients survived and sustained minimal permanent disability.
 Included in this review is a unique case of an intrauterine gunshot wound to the face at approximately 32 weeks' gestation.
 The treatment protocol, differences from adult patients, and management highlights are reviewed.
