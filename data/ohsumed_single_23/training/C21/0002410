Fatal big cat attacks.
 Two cases of fatal attacks by large cats are presented.
 In the first case, a 30-year-old female zoo worker was attacked by a jaguar that had escaped its cage.
 In the second case, a 2-year-old girl was fatally injured by her father's pet leopard.
 The pattern of injuries in these cases is nearly identical to those of these cats' prey in the wild.
