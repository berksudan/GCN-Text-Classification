Tertiary trauma care in a rural state.
 Trauma patients in rural areas usually have no access to regional trauma systems or designated trauma centers.
 Efforts to provide quality trauma care in small hospitals may seriously overextend local capabilities.
 The urban trauma center retains an important role in trauma care even when the initial care must be provided at the local level.
 Twenty-five trauma patients were transferred to University Hospital between 1985 and 1988 after definitive care was initiated in community hospitals.
 During the same time period, a total of 147 trauma patients were transferred to the trauma service.
 No information was available on the total incidence of trauma.
 Medical records were reviewed to determine the reasons for transfer.
 Major reasons included the need for further complex surgery, better critical care support, and inadequate blood banks.
 Trauma centers serving rural areas provide a valuable resource well beyond the initial 24 hours.
