The role of buspirone in the management of alcohol withdrawal: a preliminary investigation.
 One hundred eighteen patients, 77 men and 23 women ranging in age from 18 to 70 years of age, admitted to an inpatient facility in Central New York were administered buspirone HCl for treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
 Although one patient had an unwitnessed seizure, none of the subjects required discontinuance of buspirone HCl because of symptoms of dizziness, nausea, headache, nervousness, or lightheadedness, typical side effects described by the manufacturer.
 All but one of the individuals given buspirone HCl for alcohol detoxification completed that phase of treatment within six days in a manner which effectively controlled their withdrawal symptoms.
 The findings were suggestive of an important role for buspirone HCl in the detoxification of the alcohol-dependent patient using a pharmacologic agent other than traditional medications such as benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, beta blockers, magnesium sulphate, or clonidine.
