Frostbite. Methods to minimize tissue loss.
 If frostbite is to be treated successfully, direct and indirect effects of injury must be understood.
 Rapid rewarming helps to preserve tissue by limiting the amount of direct cellular injury.
 Selective management of blisters helps protect the subdermal plexus, and application of Aloe vera cream (eg, Dermaide Aloe Cream) combats the local vasoconstrictive effects of thromboxane.
 Oral administration of ibuprofen decreases systemic levels of thromboxane.
