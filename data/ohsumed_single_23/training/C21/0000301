Subtrochanteric fractures. A retrospective analysis.
 In a retrospective review of 107 patients treated during an eight-year period for subtrochanteric fractures, the average follow-up period was 25.5 months (range, six to 96 months).
 Comparisons of fracture patterns, fixation devices, and complications of osteosynthesis were made in an attempt to identify fixation devices that are best suited for the treatment of this difficult orthopedic problem.
 The Seinsheimer system of classification was used, and the fracture at risk was identified.
 Long spiral fractures with associated butterfly fragments in the osteopenic bone of elderly patients occurred most frequently, with complications of osteosynthesis and inherent instability.
 Despite the theoretic biomechanical advantages offered by the intramedullary systems, follow-up observations showed better results in patients with treatment by extramedullary devices.
