Toxicological screening: a three year experience in poisonings in Kuwait.
 The results of toxicological screening of body fluids (urine, blood and gastric lavage) from pediatric patients were analyzed for the period January 1985 - December 1988.
 Of the 119 cases, approximately one half were positive for at least one foreign substance.
 In about one fifth of the cases, multiple substances were detected.
 The most commonly implicated drugs were those acting on the central nervous system including the barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, benzodiazepines and carbamazepine.
