Isolated avulsion of the biceps femoris insertion. A case report.
 The clinical, roentgenographic, and operative findings of an isolated biceps femoris avulsion in a 21-year-old man demonstrated the significance of the static stabilizers about the knee, menisci, and articular cartilage.
 Examination of the dynamic structures about the knee, however, may present a diagnostic problem.
 A systematic examination of the musculature (hamstrings, quadriceps, and patellofemoral mechanism) should be included in the evaluation of every acute knee injury.
 Special attention should be given to the surface anatomy as well as function of the knee.
