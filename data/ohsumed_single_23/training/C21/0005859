Simultaneous reconstruction of cervical soft tissue and esophagus with a gastro-omental free flap.
 A microvascular transfer of gastric tube and omentum was used to simultaneously reconstruct cervical soft-tissue and esophageal defects in five patients.
 All patients had previous high-dose radiation and multiple flap reconstructions.
 The largest esophageal and soft-tissue defects were 10 cm and 160 cm2, respectively.
 All wounds healed primarily except for one orocutaneous fistula.
 There was one death from an intraoperative stroke.
 The gastro-omental flap is useful in cases where the reconstructive surgeon is faced with both esophageal and soft-tissue defects--particularly in heavily irradiated patients who have few reconstructive options.
