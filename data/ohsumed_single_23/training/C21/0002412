Carbon monoxide poisoning. Five-years' experience in a defined population.
 A review is presented of 302 cases in East Denmark in 1982-1986 in which the manner of death was fatal carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.
 The incidence of this far too frequent single-substance poisoning has as yet not decreased over the years despite preventive measures.
 The number of fatal CO poisoning cases may diminish as a result of a natural gas project in progress.
 The purpose of this survey, therefore, is to contribute to the evaluation of the actual causes of these fatal poisonings in East Denmark, and to discuss existing measures that prevent gas poisonings, in the expectation of a decline both in gas suicides and in accidental gas poisonings within the next few years.
