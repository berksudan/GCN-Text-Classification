The physician's role.
 Physicians can play an important role in society's response to alcohol problems.
 In diagnosis, alcohol problems among patients are frequently overlooked.
 Physicians should routinely ask patients about alcohol intake.
 In light of evidence on the effectiveness of brief interventions, especially with heavy-drinking but nondependent patients, physicians' treatment efforts should be focused in this direction.
 Patients who are alcohol dependent might best be treated by nonphysicians.
 Research contributions of physicians should be concentrated on topics for which physician input is needed: longitudinal studies of health consequences, factors contributing to mortality and health service costs, biochemical markers of alcohol use and basic pharmacology.
 Strong evidence links population alcohol consumption levels to overall harm.
 Therefore, prevention efforts should be aimed at the population as well as at people who may be at risk.
 Physicians can contribute to these efforts by influencing public policy and by setting healthy examples in their own alcohol use.
