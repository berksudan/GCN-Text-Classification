The physician's role in injury prevention: beyond the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force report.
 Injuries and their prevention have received little attention by the medical community, despite the fact that injuries are the leading cause of premature death.
 However, much can be done to reduce the number and severity of injuries, and the practicing physician has an important role to play in this process.
 This report outlines the U.S.
 Preventive Services Task Force report recommendations for prevention strategies to reduce injuries and then seeks to define a broader role for the physician in prevention injuries that extends beyond the confines of office-based practice.
 While screening and counseling have proven effectiveness in certain situations, interventions that are passive or automatic in action, such as air bags, have proven to be more effective long-term solutions to reduce both the number and the severity of injuries.
 The author outlines and provides examples of seven areas where physicians can have a major impact either directly or through implementing effective injury-control strategies.
 These are: treatment, education, screening, hazard identification, research, advocacy, and policy making.
 Using all of these approaches, physicians can play a truly effective role in reducing the burden of injuries for their patients.
