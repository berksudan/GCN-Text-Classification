Long-term prognosis of soft-tissue injuries of the neck.
 We reviewed 43 patients who had sustained soft-tissue injuries of the neck after a mean 10.8 years.
 Of these, only 12% had recovered completely.
 Residual symptoms were intrusive in 28% and severe in 12%.
 Pain in the neck and lower back was the commonest complaint and older patients had a worse prognosis.
 After two years, symptoms did not alter with further passage of time.
