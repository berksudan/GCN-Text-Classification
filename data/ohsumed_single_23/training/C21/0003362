Preventing alcohol problems: survey of Canadian medical schools.
 In preparation for a national conference on medical education in the prevention of alcohol problems, a survey of conference participants was conducted.
 Participants were undergraduate and postgraduate representatives from each Canadian medical school and representatives from 11 provincial and territorial alcohol and other drug agencies.
 There was agreement that physicians and medical schools have important roles in prevention and treatment of alcohol problems, with "traditional" medical roles seen as the most important.
 Current training is variable and was seen as inadequate, with more time devoted to treatment than prevention.
 To correct this situation, renewed priorities and faculty leadership are needed.
 Respondents felt that there should be uniform standards for assessing undergraduate students' skills in dealing with alcohol problems.
 Provincial alcohol and other drug agencies are underused in medical education in the prevention and treatment of alcohol problems.
