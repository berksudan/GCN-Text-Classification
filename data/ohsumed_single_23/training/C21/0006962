Age effect on prognosis for functional recovery in acute, traumatic central cord syndrome.
 The purpose of this study was to determine if age is significant in functional recovery in acute, traumatic central cord syndrome (CCS).
 Recovery of ambulation, ADL status, and bowel and bladder function were evaluated.
 A retrospective study tested the hypothesis that functional recovery in 51 consecutive CCS patients was better in younger patients than in older patients.
 Four patients, all more than 50 years, died.
 Ability to ambulate independently at discharge was compared in 30 patients younger than 50 years with 21 patients 50 years or older.
 Results showed that 29 of 30 (97%) of the younger patients were ambulatory compared to seven of 17 (41%) of the older patients (p less than .002).
 The younger patients were also able to achieve independence in self-care and bowel and bladder function in a significantly greater proportion.
 The prognosis for functional recovery in acute traumatic CCS should consider the patient's age.
 The prognosis is less optimistic in older patients, but it is considerably more favorable in younger patients than previously reported.
