Penetrating injuries of the abdominal aorta.
 The charts of 56 consecutive patients with penetrating injuries to the abdominal aorta were reviewed in an attempt to identify prognostic factors.
 Mechanism of injury was gunshot wound (GSW), 82 per cent (.22 cal: 15.2%; greater than .38 cal: 84.8%); shotgun wound (SGW), 5 per cent; and stab wound (SW), 13 per cent.
 Overall mortality was 73 per cent, with GSW 78 per cent (.22 cal: 0%; greater than .38 cal: 92%), 67 per cent with SGW, and 43 per cent with SW.
 Average initial systolic blood pressure (ISBP) was 53 (0-130); 87 (0-120) in survivors; and 40 (0-130) in nonsurvivors (NS).
 Eighteen patients (32%) had no ISBP, with one survivor.
 Thirty (54%) patients had ISBP less than 70, with three survivors.
 Six Emergency Department (ED) thoracotomies were performed, with five patients surviving to reach the operating room (OR), and none surviving long-term.
 Ten patients died in the ED, 18 during surgical intervention, six within 24 hr, and seven greater than 24 hr postop.
 Average time from injury to OR was 75 minutes, with 122 minutes in survivors, and 53 minutes in nonsurvivors (P less than 0.05); 49 minutes in those dying in the OR; and 58 minutes in those surviving the OR but dying postop (NS).
 At surgery, six patients had thoracotomy before celiotomy for control of the thoracic aorta, with three surviving the OR and two surviving long-term.
 Survivors had 2.53 associated injuries; nonsurvivors had 2.89 (NS).
 No significant difference was noted in number or location of associated injuries between survivors and nonsurvivors.
