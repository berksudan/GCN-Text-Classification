Hair dryer burns in children.
 Three children with burn injuries caused by home hair dryers are described.
 In one patient the injury was believed to be accidental, and in the other two cases the injuries were deliberately caused by a caretaker.
 The lack of prior experience with hair dryer burns initially led to suspicion of other causes.
 The characteristics of each case aided in the final determination of accidental vs nonaccidental injury.
 These cases prompted testing of home hair dryers to determine their heat output.
 At the highest heat settings, the dryers rapidly generated temperatures in excess of 110 degrees C.
 After the dryers were turned off, the protective grills maintained sufficient temperatures to cause full-thickness burns for up to 2 minutes.
 These cases and the results of testing demonstrate that hair dryers must be added to the list of known causes of accidental and nonaccidental burns in children.
