Public support for policy initiatives regulating alcohol use in Minnesota: a multi-community survey.
 Public support for policies to control alcohol sales and consumption was surveyed in seven Minnesota communities.
 A total of 438 women and 383 men were asked to indicate their level of support of or opposition to nine different proposals designed to regulate alcohol.
 There was general support for all policies, which was strongly related to characteristics of respondents and type of policy proposed.
 Women were significantly more supportive of all items than were men.
 Marriage, older age and low alcohol consumption were also associated with support.
 Education and voter status generally were not.
 Policies and activities that serve primarily to protect youth received the strongest support.
 Restrictions and prohibitions such as limiting advertisements were less popular.
 The least support was expressed for increases in taxes on alcohol and for measures that would eliminate an existing practice such as prohibiting wine-cooler sales at convenience stores.
 The majority of respondents also indicated that they felt the individual, as opposed to the manufacturer or retailer, was responsible for problems associated with alcohol and should be the focus of intervention.
 Strategies for shifting the focus from the individual to environmental and regulatory control are discussed.
