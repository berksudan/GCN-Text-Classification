Discharge videotaping: a means of augmenting occupational and physical therapy.
 Regional burn centers commonly receive patients from medical facilities that are geographically distant.
 Logistic problems that may hamper follow-up care in the burn center can lead to a decrease in function as a result of contractures and hypertrophic scar formation.
 Inexperience on the part of therapists at community facilities serves to intensify this problem.
 Discharge videotaping, with respect to physical and occupational therapy programs, is a means of documenting range of motion at the time of discharge and providing visual documentation of the therapy program to be followed on an outpatient basis.
 The video tapes are forwarded to the outlying community hospital's therapy department in order to accomplish these goals.
