The lateral arm fascial free flap: its anatomy and use in reconstruction.
 Free fascial transfer has been used for reconstruction of gliding surfaces of the upper and lower extremities or when thin, pliable coverage is required (hand, heel, nose, and ear).
 In our experience with the lateral arm fasciocutaneous flap, we have found that the fascia alone is an excellent source of tissue for free flap transfer.
 A thorough investigation of the microscopic, gross, and radiographic anatomy of the lateral arm fascia was undertaken by the study of 25 fresh cadavers.
 Vascular pathways were mapped, their locations were analyzed, and then they were correlated with the elevation, design, and transfer of the flap.
 The lateral arm has a large fascial component located anterior and posterior to the lateral intermuscular septum, which itself lies between the triceps and the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles.
 It is perfused by the posterior radial collateral artery (PRCA), one of the terminal branches of the profunda brachii.
 This vessel (PRCA) provides at least four fascial branches from 1 to 15 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyle, the largest of which is located an average of 9.7 cm superior to the lateral epicondyle.
 Fascia up to 12 x 9 cm may be used with good axial perfusion.
 The histologic cross sections demonstrate the complex anatomy of the fascia itself, as well as its relation to the nutrient vessels.
 We have applied the lateral arm fascial flap in five cases of upper extremity reconstruction.
 We have also found this flap valuable in preservation of underlying anatomic detail for total reconstruction of the ear and nose when local tissue and more conventional flaps were not available.
