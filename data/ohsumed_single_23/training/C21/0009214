Pathologic synovial plica of the knee. Results of conservative treatment.
 Observations of 136 cases of pathologic synovial plica of the knee were analyzed with regard to etiology, symptoms, and the results of conservative treatment.
 The results obtained with conservative treatment were good in 40% of cases, average in 20%, and poor in 40%.
 In our opinion, these results justify the treatment of this condition with physical therapy before proceeding with surgical correction.
 The objective of physical therapy was to decrease the compressive forces in the anterior compartment of the knee by increasing the structural flexibility of the flexor and extensor muscles.
 This increase in flexibility was obtained by instituting stretching exercises for the hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps.
