Field performance of the Intoxilyzer 5000: a comparison of blood- and breath-alcohol results in Wisconsin drivers.
 Intoxilyzer 5000 and blood-alcohol results from drivers arrested for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and for related offenses were compared during a two-year period.
 Three hundred and ninety-five pairs of results were studied.
 The breath- and blood-alcohol specimens in this study were collected within 1 h of each other.
 The mean blood-alcohol concentration obtained was 0.180 g/dL, with a range from zero to 0.338 g/dL.
 By comparison, the mean Intoxilyzer 5000 result was 0.16 g/210 L with a range from zero to 0.32 g/210 L.
 Compared with the blood-alcohol result, Intoxilyzer 5000 results were lower by more than 0.01 g/210 L 67% of the time, within 0.01 g/210 L 31% of the time, and higher by more than 0.01 g/210 L 2% of the time.
