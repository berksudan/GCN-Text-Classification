Basophil releasability in severely burned patients.
 Thermal injury is known to induce dysregulation of the immune system; however, the precise mechanisms have to be clarified.
 We investigated the histamine release of basophil granulocytes from severely burned patients (n = 12) after stimulation with anti-IgE or the Ca-ionophore A 23187, respectively.
 The anti-IgE-induced basophil histamine release of all patients was reduced in comparison to healthy donors beginning at day one postburn (p.b.) (5.0 +/- 2.3% vs.
 30.5 +/-3.4%), while the Ca-ionophore-induced release was not decreased before day two p.b.
 Basophils of patients who finally succumbed to their injuries showed poor responsiveness (to zero levels) over the total time.
 In contrast, the basophil releasability of surviving patients returned to nearly normal levels (fifth to seventh week p.b.).
 Already in the second week p.b.
 there was a significant difference in histamine release between survivors and nonsurvivors [e.g., days 6-9 p.b.: 23.7 +/- 4.0 vs.
 6.9 +/- 2.7 (p less than 0.005) after Ca-ionophore stimulation].
 The altered basophil histamine release was neither due to a diminished dose- or a delayed time-response to the stimuli nor due to differences in the basophil counts or the cellular histamine content.
 Our data indicate that the decrease of the basophil releasability, which may be secondary to altered signal transduction pathways in severely burned patients correlates with the clinical outcome.
