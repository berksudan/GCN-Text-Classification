Identification of the driver in an automobile collision.
 We report on a three-occupant automobile collision in which one of the two survivors claimed that the deceased had operated the vehicle.
 We attempted to identify the driver.
 The left face and neck of the deceased appeared to have struck the vehicle's interior.
 The survivors were slightly injured on the right side of their faces.
 In Japan, the passenger side is on the left, and in this case, the right side of the vehicle had been damaged.
 By comparing the injuries of the deceased and the survivors in relation to the vehicle damages, we concluded that the deceased occupant had probably been a passenger, not the driver.
