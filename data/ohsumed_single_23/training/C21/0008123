Familial values as factors influencing long-term psychological adjustment of children after severe burn injury.
 This study replicates earlier findings that children who survive severe burn injury do make positive psychological adjustment.
 Family support and a family value of autonomy were predicted to be critical variables in promotion of psychological adjustment.
 In addition, the study presents the hypothesis that length of time after burn injury and level of intelligence are contributing factors in psychological adjustment.
 Forty-four adolescents with a mean of 60% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness burns were studied.
 Half of the subjects scored within the normal range on a measure of psychological adjustment.
 Familial value patterns were critical in the prediction of psychological adjustment.
 Positive psychological adjustment was predicted by greater family cohesion, independence, and more open expressiveness within the family.
 Level of intelligence did not contribute to adjustment.
 Length of time after injury, if it is important to psychological healing, appears to be a factor only during the initial 2 years after burn injury.
