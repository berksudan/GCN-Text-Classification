Corticocancellous grafting and an AO/ASIF lag screw for nonunion of the scaphoid. A retrospective analysis.
 We report our experience in 42 patients, using corticocancellous bone grafts and lag screw fixation for un-united scaphoid fractures.
 Using a grading system, we analysed the suitability of the method for three types of nonunion.
 We recommend the operation for the treatment of scaphoid nonunion, except where there is avascular necrosis of the proximal pole.
