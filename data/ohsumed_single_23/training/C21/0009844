The scapular manipulation technique for the reduction of acute anterior shoulder dislocations.
 Anterior shoulder dislocations are a common occurrence in busy emergency departments.
 Numerous techniques for treating this problem have been reported.
 The majority of these techniques use traction and leverage of the humerus, often requiring considerable force and causing significant patient discomfort.
 We report a simple, relatively painless, and atraumatic method of shoulder reduction involving manipulation of the scapula as well as the humerus.
 This technique has been used in our emergency department with considerable success and no complications.
