Mineralogic parameters related to amosite asbestos-induced fibrosis in humans.
 We have previously shown that in the lungs of a group of chrysotile miners and millers, grade of interstitial fibrosis (asbestosis) is directly proportional to tremolite fiber or chrysotile fiber concentration but is inversely proportional to mean fiber length and length-related parameters.
 To compare the effects of the commercial amphibole asbestos amosite on parenchymal fibrosis, we histologically graded fibrosis in four different sites in the lungs of 20 shipyard and insulation workers with heavy amosite exposure and measured by analytic electron microscopy fiber concentration and size in corresponding portions of lung tissue.
 Fibrosis grade was found to be strongly positively correlated with amosite concentration and negatively correlated with mean fiber size parameters, including fiber length, width, surface area, and mass.
 A comparison of our present results with our data on the chrysotile miners and millers showed that the regression lines of fibrosis grade versus concentration for amosite, chrysotile, and tremolite were statistically different.
 These findings indicate that amosite concentration, like chrysotile and tremolite concentration, is closely and directly related to fibrosis at the local lung level.
 Furthermore, these observations again raise the possibility that short fibers may be more important than is commonly believed in the genesis of fibrosis in man.
 Last, the concentration comparison data indicate that, fiber for fiber, amosite is more fibrogenic than is chrysotile or tremolite, and indirectly suggest that tremolite is more fibrogenic than is chrysotile.
