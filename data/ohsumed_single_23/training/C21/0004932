Conventional radiographic and computed tomographic findings in cases of fracture of the mandibular condylar process.
 A total of 40 patients with 46 fractures of the mandibular condylar process were examined an average of 47 months after the injury.
 The conventional radiologic examination consisted of panoramic radiography and lateral transcranial view of the fracture in the mouth-open and mouth-closed positions.
 Sixteen patients with 21 fractures of the condylar process were examined additionally by computed tomography (CT) because of temporomandibular joint problems in the sagittal and coronal projection.
 Computed tomography revealed bony changes in the fractured mandibular condyle and its position in the mandibular fossa more exactly than conventional radiographic examinations.
 Furthermore, the results showed that disturbances in the position and function of the articular disc may be more common than was earlier anticipated, suggesting the more frequent use of CT examinations to evaluate temporomandibular joint changes after condylar process fractures.
