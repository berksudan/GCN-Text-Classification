Pulmonary circulation and burns and trauma.
 The lung is a critical organ in victims of thermal injury or multiple trauma since the blood that drains injured organs circulates through the pulmonary circulation before passing through any other organ.
 The lung therefore will receive the first volley of cytotoxins released postinjury.
 In addition to being a target of injury, the lung may also contribute to the injury of systemic organs.
 This injury may be the result of a reduced delivery of oxygenated blood or the direct release of cytotoxins into the systemic circulation.
 The injury to the lung may be to the pulmonary microvasculature or the airway.
 The bronchial circulation responds to injury by a marked elevation in its blood flow and microvascular permeability.
 These latter effects may be important in mediating the changes which occur in the lung parenchyma.
