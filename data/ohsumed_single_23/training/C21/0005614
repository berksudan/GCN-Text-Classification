Leakage of fluid administered epidurally to rats into subcutaneous tissue 
 Epidural catheters were implanted in rats under halothane/nitrous oxide anaesthesia.
 Contrast medium (Iopamidol) was injected via the catheter under fluoroscopic control 24-48 h after implantation.
 In 15 of 20 rats contrast could be seen leaking out of the epidural space, usually after only 25 microliters was administered.
 Leakage was associated with diminished antinociceptive response to morphine administered via the catheter.
 Both leakage and decreased response to morphine could be largely prevented by applying a drop of Supa-Glue over the site of entry of the catheter to the epidural space at the time of catheter implantation.
 Investigators using epidurally cannulated rats should document that leakage does not occur or discard results from rats showing evidence of leakage.
