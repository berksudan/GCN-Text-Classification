Blunt trauma to the heart: the pathophysiology of injury.
 Blunt injuries to the heart are common and potentially lethal.
 These injuries often go undetected while more obvious problems are treated.
 A cardiac injury should be suspected in any patient who sustains severe chest trauma.
 The spectrum of cardiac trauma ranges from injuries with no actual cellular damage (myocardial concussion) to cardiac chamber rupture.
 The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of these injuries are discussed.
