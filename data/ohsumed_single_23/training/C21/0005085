Salvage posterior urethroplasty after failed initial repair of pelvic fracture membranous urethral defects.
 Experience with 20 salvage urethroplasties in patients with pelvic fracture membranous urethral defects who failed previous delayed urethroplasty is presented.
 A total of 15 patients was successfully managed by 1-stage procedures, 14 by bulboprostatic reanastomosis and 1 by a tubed pedicled island of skin.
 Substitution urethroplasty with a staged perineoscrotal skin tube inlay was performed in 5 patients in whom an anastomosis could not be achieved either due to an excessively long urethral defect or inelasticity of the anterior urethra precluding its elongation for an anastomosis free of tension.
 A successful result was achieved in 19 of the 20 patients (95%).
 The rationale for procedure selection is discussed.
