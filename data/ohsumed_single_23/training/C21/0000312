A ten-year review of treatment of delayed union and nonunion with an implanted bone growth stimulator.
 A ten-year clinical and roentgenographic review was conducted on the patients in the original Australian multicenter trial that evaluated use of an implantable bone growth stimulator for delayed union and nonunion.
 Of the original 81 patients, 38 patients were located, seven patients had died from unrelated causes, and 36 were unlocatable.
 Of the 38 patients located, 37 patients (representing 38 fractures) participated in a detailed clinical review and had a roentgenographic assessment.
 All fractures had remained united, and normal bone remodeling had occurred.
 There were no adverse effects of the generator or cathode wire.
 Six patients initially reported as failures had healed after further surgical intervention.
 Thus, normal osteogenesis occurs in association with electrical stimulation using an implantable bone growth stimulator.
 This ten-year review supports the long-term safety and effectiveness of this technique in treating nonuniting fractures.
