Cyclosporine A for prolonging allograft survival in patients with massive burns.
 Cyclosporine A (CsA) immunosuppression was used in three patients with massive burns to prolong skin allograft survival.
 Cyclosporine A kinetic studies in patients with burns revealed markedly accelerated blood clearance and high variability in drug absorption when compared with studies in renal transplantation patients.
 Doses required to maintain therapeutic levels varied widely.
 While patients were receiving adequate maintenance therapy with CsA immunosuppression the allograft was tightly adherent without gross or microscopic rejection and was indistinguishable from autograft.
 Ultimately, patients' wounds were permanently covered with sequential autografts by recropping limited donor sites.
 There were not unusual septic complications, although prophylaxis for opportunistic infections was used.
 The disadvantage of allograft use is its early rejection and obligatory replacement until permanent coverage with autograft can be accomplished.
 Cyclosporine A can prolong allograft survival and allow autograft coverage from limited donor sites in a sequential fashion.
 This may lead to increased survival in patients with massive burns.
