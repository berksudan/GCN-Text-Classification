The role of spinal flexibility in back pain complaints within industry. A prospective study.
 Commonly used clinical measurements of spinal flexibility in the sagittal and frontal planes were examined as predictors of future back pain reports within industry.
 The study sample consisted of 3,020 aircraft manufacturing employees who were examined and tracked for more than 4 years for reports of back pain.
 Modified Schober, sit-and-reach, and lateral bending measurements were not significantly associated with risk of future back pain reporting, nor were any trends present.
 There was a statistically significant relationship between decreased flexibility and reports of current or previous back problems.
 However, the differences in flexibility between subjects with and without a history of back problems were too small to be of practical significance.
