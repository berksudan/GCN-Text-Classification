The detection of alcoholism in hospitalized schizophrenics: a comparison of the MAST and the MAC.
 The Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) and the MacAndrew Alcoholism Scale (MAC) were administered to forty-one schizophrenic inpatients also meeting DSM-III criteria for either alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence and 29 schizophrenic inpatients who did not qualify for an additional substance abuse diagnosis other than marijuana abuse/dependence.
 The MAC failed to differentiate between the alcoholic and nonalcoholic groups and both groups scored above the recommended cutting score.
 The MAST significantly differentiated the alcoholic and nonalcoholic schizophrenic patients and was as sensitive to a history of alcohol abuse as to alcohol dependence.
 Neither the MAST nor MAC was sensitive to recent versus more remote drinking.
 The overall classificatory accuracy of the MAST was found to be 80% and that of the MAC was 56%.
 A logistic regression analysis revealed that the use of just four MAST items can yield a group classificatory rate of 83%.
 It was concluded that the MAST exhibited sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as an initial screening instrument for alcoholism in schizophrenic patients.
