Whole-bowel irrigation as treatment for zinc sulfate overdose.
 A 16-year-old boy ingested approximately 50 zinc sulfate tablets (ZnSO4; 500-mg tablets).
 After spontaneous emesis, ipecac-induced emesis, and orogastric lavage, an abdominal radiograph performed four hours after ingestion still demonstrated approximately 50 ZnSO4 tablets within the stomach and three pills within the colon.
 Whole-bowel irrigation was begun with a polyethylene glycol lavage solution (PEG; Golytely) that was administered through a nasogastric tube; within one hour, the patient began producing a rectal effluent that contained pills.
 The patient remained asymptomatic throughout whole-bowel irrigation.
 Stool guaiac tests were negative.
 The serum chloride, however, increased from 105 to 127 mEq/L.
 Follow-up kidney, ureter, and bladder studies demonstrated the clearance of the zinc tablets from the gastrointestinal tract during the next 24 hours.
