Effects of 4-methylpyrazole, methanol/ethylene glycol antidote, in healthy humans.
 4-Methylpyrazole (4-MP), an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, may be useful for the treatment of methanol and ethylene glycol intoxications.
 A placebo-controlled, double blind, multiple dose, sequential, ascending-dose study has been performed to determine the tolerance of 4-MP in healthy volunteers.
 Oral loading doses of 4-MP were followed by supplemental doses every 12 h through 5 days, producing plasma levels in the therapeutic range.
 A slight, transient elevation in one or both serum transaminase values was observed in 6 of the 15 subjects treated with 4-MP.
 This effect was not dose related nor apparently mediated through a hypersensitivity reaction.
 Serum triglyceride levels were increased in 30% of 4-MP treated subjects, but also in 25% of the placebo subjects.
 4-MP treatment did not produce any other significant changes in objective clinical parameters nor in subjective side effects.
 The results suggest that a mild, transient increase in liver function tests might be observed in some subjects treated with multiple doses of 4-MP.
 Nevertheless, the slower elimination rate and lesser degree of toxicity of 4-MP would make it preferable to ethanol in therapy of these poisonings.
