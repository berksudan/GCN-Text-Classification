Genucom knee analysis system: reproducibility and database development.
 The Genucom is a relatively new computerized system that performs a multidimensional analysis of knee laxity.
 Therefore, the purposes of the present investigation were twofold: 1) to estimate the reproducibility of the testing system in its ability to obtain similar test values on the same test subject within a back-to-back two-test protocol and 2) to develop a database of normal values as a standard against which values of suspected ligament injury can be compared to reliably determine whether, in fact, ligament injury has occurred.
 In the reproducibility phase of the study, 20 subjects were tested in two trials each of eight tests, yielding 20 separate test values per trial, accounting for each angle of flexion and plane of force tested.
 Both legs were tested, providing an N of 40.
 Test-retest correlations of the two trials and dependent t-tests indicated that the Genucom provided generally stable and reproducible results.
 In the normal value database phase of the study, 218 different subjects were given one trial of the same eight tests.
 Testing of both legs provided an N greater than 400.
 Means and standard deviations were calculated for each test.
