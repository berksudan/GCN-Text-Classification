Biomechanical strength of non-vascularised and vascularised diaphyseal bone transplants. An experimental study.
 We studied the healing and torsional strength of non-vascularised (28) and vascularised (28) sections of tibial diaphyses in 56 cats.
 Both types of graft achieved fracture union in the same period of time, and at 12 and 16 weeks the non-vascularised grafts were as strong as the vascularised grafts.
