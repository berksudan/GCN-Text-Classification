Scapular dislocation (locked scapula).
 We report the case of a 19-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with pain and inability to move her right shoulder after falling backwards and striking it on a cart.
 Radiographs of the shoulder revealed a dislocated scapula.
 Closed reduction in the ED was successful.
 This rare case of scapular dislocation serves to emphasize that a heightened awareness for this injury is necessary if it is to be recognized and treated appropriately.
 Its treatment and prognosis are reviewed.
