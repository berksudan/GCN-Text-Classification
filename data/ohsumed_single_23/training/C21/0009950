Effect of early feeding on the postburn hypermetabolic response in rats.
 The effect of early enteral feeding on the hypermetabolic response following burn injury in a rat burn model has been investigated.
 The rates of heat production and partitioned heat loss were determined on the fourteenth postburn day for five treatment groups: I) burn, fed rat chow ad libitum starting 2 hours postburn; II) burn, fed by gastrostomy beginning 2 hours postburn; III) burn, fed by gastrostomy, delayed until 72 hours postburn; IV) controls, fed by gastrostomy 2 hours post anesthesia; and V) controls, fed rat chow ad libitum 2 hours post anesthesia.
 Gastrostomy feedings delivered 175 kcal/kg.day.
 The mean rates of heat production and heat loss for the three burn groups did not differ significantly whether rats were fed chow ad libitum, or by gastrostomy early or late.
 Contrary to previous studies using a guinea pig model, method and timing of feeding in this burned rat model had no significant effect on the postburn increment in the rate of heat loss and the corresponding increment in the rate of heat production.
