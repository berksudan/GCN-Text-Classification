Controlled tissue expansion of a groin flap for upper extremity reconstruction.
 A large upper extremity defect in an 8-year-old girl was resurfaced with an expanded groin flap.
 Tissue expansion allowed complete coverage of the defect while minimizing the donor deformity.
 Pretransfer expansion of pedicled flaps offers an alternative to free-flap reconstruction of complex upper extremity defects.
 This is especially valuable in the pediatric patient, in whom donor-site morbidity can be significant.
