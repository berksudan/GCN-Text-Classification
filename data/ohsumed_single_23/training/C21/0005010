Case management in addictions treatment.
 The need for case management in addictions treatment systems has been recognized for at least 10 years.
 As more attention is paid to developing this treatment component and as more data are available concerning the implementation of case management in addictions, it is becoming apparent that there is a lack of consensus concerning who should provide case management and how it should be defined.
 This paper reviews sources of variability of case management services identified in the mental health field and discusses the implications for the development of case management in addictions programs.
