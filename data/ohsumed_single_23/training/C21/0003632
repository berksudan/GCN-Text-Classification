The latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap for extremity reconstruction in orthopedic surgery.
 The latissimus dorsi was transferred as a pedicle flap in ten patients and as a free vascular flap in ten others for extremity reconstruction.
 Group I comprised ten patients in whom the transfer was used solely to cover a skin or soft-tissue defect.
 Although there was partial necrosis of the transferred skin in one patient, the remaining nine patients obtained complete coverage without further reconstructive surgery.
 Group II comprised five patients in whom transfer of the latissimus dorsi was performed for active flexion or extension of the elbow or for abduction of the shoulder.
 Postoperatively, muscle strength obtained was classified from Grades 0 to 5 according to the muscle testing method.
 Three patients obtained muscle strength of Grade 3, while two obtained Grade 2.
 Group III comprised five patients who had brachial plexus palsy after high-dose irradiation.
 Coverage of the skin and soft tissue was performed after neurolysis of the brachial plexus palsy to free the tissue bed of scarred tissue.
 Postoperatively, sensory and motor disturbances were alleviated in four of five patients.
