Calcium carbonate gel therapy for hydrofluoric acid burns of the hand.
 Hydrofluoric acid is used extensively as an industrial cleaning agent for metals and glass.
 Many workers are injured by cutaneous contact of the acid with exposed skin surfaces, particularly hands.
 Hydrofluoric acid burns are characterized by delayed onset of symptomatology with skin ulceration, and severe pain may be of extended duration.
 Treatment of hydrofluoric acid burns traditionally has consisted of local infiltration or intraarterial injections of calcium solutions.
 These injections are painful and frequently require retreatment.
 A new treatment utilizing a topical gel of calcium carbonate is described.
 Nine patients have been treated for hydrofluoric acid burns of the hand with calcium carbonate gel applied topically and covered with occlusive glove dressings.
 A gel slurry is compounded from calcium carbonate tablets and K-Y Jelly.
 Fingernails of the affected fingers are removed if a subungual burn is obvious.
 The gel is put into a surgeon's glove and placed over the burned hand.
 The patient replaces the glove and slurry every 4 hours for 24 hours.
 After the first day, the glove is discontinued unless there is resumption of painful symptoms.
 Full range of motion is encouraged during this interval.
 The calcium carbonate gel technique was successfully utilized in nine patients with no further need for injection therapy.
 In these patients, pain relief was obtained within 4 hours of treatment, with no further progression of skin ulceration.
 No reconstructive procedures were required in any patient, and only one patient did not return to full-duty work within 1 week.
 There were no long-term sequelae from burns treated with this topical therapy, except one patient, who presenting 24 hours after the burn, developed a digital tip neuroma that was excised.
