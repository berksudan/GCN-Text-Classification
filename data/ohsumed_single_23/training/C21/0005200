Alcohol consumption by college undergraduates: current use and 10-year trends.
 In a carefully executed study with a high response rate, a random sample of 10% of the undergraduate student body at a rural New England university was surveyed as to the subjects' use of alcohol in 1987.
 Over 87% of the surveyed students returned questionnaires.
 The results were compared to similar studies conducted on the campus in 1977 and 1983.
 "Daily or almost daily" use of alcohol was registered by 4.7% of the respondents, which represents a continuing decrease in daily consumption from earlier studies.
 One-fourth of the sample indicated drinking only one drink or fewer per week, contrary to the common perception on the campus.
 Nevertheless, 25.5% recorded a hangover, 7.5% recorded vomiting from drinking too much and 4.4% recorded a blackout, all "in the last week." Compared to the U.S.
 population, alcohol consumption appears to be more evenly distributed in the college sample but, still, most of the drinking is done by one-fifth of both groups.
