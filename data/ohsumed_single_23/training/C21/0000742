Locked intramedullary nailing for displaced tibial shaft fractures [published erratum appears in J Bone Joint Surg [Br] 1991 Jan;73(1):181]
 We analysed the results of 93 tibial shaft fractures treated with the Grosse-Kempf locked nail.
 Twenty-six fractures were comminuted, 19 were open grade I to II, and 54 were located outside the middle third of the tibia.
 The deep infection rate was 3.2%.
 There were only two poor results.
 The use of this method is recommended and discussed.
