Case report: severe ethylene glycol intoxication with normal osmolal gap--"a chilling thought".
 This is a case of a 23-year-old male presenting with altered sensorium, vomiting, and right flank pain.
 Despite a normal osmolal gap, he was found to be suffering from ethylene glycol intoxication.
 This little-described presentation can result in the clinician failing to consider ethylene glycol as a causative agent.
