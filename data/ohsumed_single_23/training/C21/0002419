Fatal high cervical spinal cord injury in an automobile accident complicating os odontoideum.
 We report a case where spinal instability from incomplete fusion of the dens of C2 (os odontoideum) allowed anterior displacement of the skull and first cervical vertebra following right frontal impact against the A pillar in an automobile accident.
 Resultant crushing and laceration of the spinal cord occurred at the level of C1 and C2.
 Without either radiographic investigation or detailed examination of the spine, the fatal injury might have been overlooked and death attributed to acute alcoholic poisoning because the blood alcohol level was .613%.
