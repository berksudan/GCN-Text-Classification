Effects of nonparticipation in trauma center system on emergency department utilization.
 The University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) serves an inner-city urban population in one of the highest crime rate districts in Chicago.
 On May 20, 1986, the city's Level I Trauma ordinance took effect with the University of Illinois Hospital declining to participate.
 To measure the impact of the ordinance on a nonparticipating hospital, we undertook a retrospective analysis of our trauma patient utilization statistics.
 Consecutive monthly patient census data of 71 months was compiled with emphasis on patient presenting complaints and related subspecialty evaluation.
 We observed significant decreases of patients presenting with head injuries, fractures, and animal bites as well as with major trauma, minor trauma, and general surgery hospital admission.
 The final disposition of the patients arriving by ambulance was consistent with the observed decrease in major traumatic conditions and in minor traumatic conditions.
 However, the mean number of patient presentations per day (ppd) admitted to regular medical or surgical beds decreased from 2.70 ppd to 2.30 ppd while the mean number of ppd sent home increased from 2.64 ppd to 3.49 ppd.
 These data suggest that loss of trauma center status designation has a profound effect on utilization of emergency departments not participating in the trauma system.
 Nonparticipation appears to be associated with a significant decrease in utilization rates for major and minor trauma patients and a significant increase in the number of patients discharged who had arrived by the Chicago Fire Department Paramedic System (CFD).
 This effect on the emergency department extends to utilization of inpatient services.
