Injury patterns in Scottish heavy athletics.
 As interest and participation in the athletics of Scottish-American Highland games has increased throughout the United States, the aim of this study was to define injury patterns and risk factors.
 Field events of modern track and field evolved in part from the seven events of the "heavy athletics." A retrospective and prospective study of 170 athletes with at least 3 years of experience was carried out over 10 years.
 There were 729 injuries, 60% of which involved the upper extremities and back.
 The incidence of injury was 42.9%; there was an injury exposure rate of 0.3 per 40 hours of competition or training.
 With appropriate instruction, a consistent weight program, and exercise, few injuries were serious.
