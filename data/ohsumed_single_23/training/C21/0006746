Porta hepatis disruption from blunt trauma.
 Extrahepatic porta hepatis injuries from blunt abdominal trauma are exceedingly rare; all recently reported cases involve disruption of the common bile duct at its intrapancreatic portion.
 We herein report a patient with lacerations of the proper hepatic artery and bile duct occurring from deceleration/torsion of the porta hepatis after high speed vehicular collision.
