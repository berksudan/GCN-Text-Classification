Murine model of ethanol-induced immunosuppression.
 Alcohol abuse has been associated with an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases and certain tumors.
 On the basis of these observations, an effect of ethanol on the immune system has been suggested.
 We have used a mouse model system in which male C57Bl/6 mice were fed either Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing ethanol sufficient to supply 37% of the total calories or isocaloric control diet in a pair-feeding design to examine the effect of ethanol on the immune system.
 The group consuming the ethanol-containing diet maintained relatively stable levels of blood ethanol for the 8 days of feeding.
 Consumption of ethanol for 8 days resulted in a profound loss of thymus and spleen cells, and the recovery of thymus cellularity was delayed relative to the recovery of spleen cell numbers after ethanol feeding was discontinued.
 Proliferation of spleen lymphocytes to T-cell stimuli (concanavalin A and alloantigens) was diminished; however, B-cell proliferation to lipopolysaccharide was relatively unchanged in mice fed ethanol-containing diet.
 Also in ethanol-fed mice a significant decrease in the primary antibody response to sheep red blood cells but not to the T-independent antigen trinitrophenol-ficoll occurred.
 These data establish the murine model system as a means to define further the effect of ethanol on the immune system and host defense mechanisms.
