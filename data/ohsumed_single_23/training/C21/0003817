Acute intoxication.
 Acute alcohol intoxication is a commonly encountered clinical presentation in Emergency Medicine.
 Its role should be considered in many Emergency Department presentations, specifically in major and minor trauma, and in gastrointestinal, metabolic, neurologic, and psychiatric disorders.
 The differential diagnosis of change in mental status must be considered in all intoxicated patients.
 Management of intoxicated patients is generally supportive although complications of chronic alcoholism should be considered.
 Management should consist of correction of complications resultant from intoxication, as well as observation and the provision of a safe environment for the patient during the recovery phase of acute intoxication.
