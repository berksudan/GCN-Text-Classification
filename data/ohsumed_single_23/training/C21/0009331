Motor unit numbers and contractile properties after spinal cord injury.
 The number of motor units in the thenar muscle group was estimated in 11 patients with cervical spinal cord injuries.
 The surface electromyogram and twitch force, in response to maximal stimulation of the median nerve was divided by the average surface electromyogram and twitch of single units.
 The average single unit size was obtained by intramuscular microstimulation of motor nerve branches and by graded whole nerve stimulation, which provided three independent estimates, two based on the electromyogram and one based on force.
 The motor unit estimates from the patients covered a wide range.
 Some had essentially normal motor units both in numbers and contractile properties, while others had varying reductions in numbers of units.
 Those patients who showed a large reduction in motor unit numbers also had greatly enlarged units, which produced an average of up to sixfold the normal force.
 These enlarged units summed to produce maximal compound action potentials and twitches that were sometimes indistinguishable from normal.
 Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the cervical spine obtained from some patients provided independent evidence that patients with low motor unit counts had sustained direct injury to the anterior aspect of the spinal cord at the relevant segmental levels.
 Some patients showed a normal number of motor units long after the injury.
 No evidence of transneuronal degeneration could be demonstrated in the thenar group in these patients with the current techniques.
