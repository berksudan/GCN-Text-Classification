Health locus of control beliefs and alcohol-related factors that may influence treatment outcomes.
 Treatment programs have based their treatment approach on the premise that alcoholics should exert internal control over situations and events that affect them.
 Since chronic alcohol use affects the health of an individual, Walston and Walston's Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale was administered to 47 alcoholics in a treatment program.
 The population reflected a higher belief that health status is more under their own control than under the control of chance or powerful others.
 However, the results indicated that recovering alcoholics with a more powerful other health orientation tended to maintain membership longer with Alcoholics Anonymous, would seek help sooner, would begin heavy drinking at a later age, and would attempt formal treatment more often.
