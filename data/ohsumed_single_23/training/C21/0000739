The AO dynamic hip screw and the Pugh sliding nail in femoral head fixation.
 We compared, under laboratory conditions, the resistance to cutting out of the AO dynamic hip screw and the Pugh sliding nail.
 The mean load at cut out, adjusted for bone strength, was 70% greater for the Pugh sliding nail.
 The reasons for this difference are discussed.
