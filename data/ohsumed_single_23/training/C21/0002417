Path of bullet and injuries determined by radiography.
 Radiography is commonly used to find bullet pathways in forensic pathology.
 In the case presented here, a man had sustained multiple gunshot wounds and one bullet could not be traced.
 A radiograph was used to find the bullet and showed an interesting bullet pathway.
 By observing the bullet pathway on a radiograph, sometimes we can surmise the victim's body posture at the time of an incident.
