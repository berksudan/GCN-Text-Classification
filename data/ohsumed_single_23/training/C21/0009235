Trend toward nonoperative management of splenic injuries.
 Treatment of splenic injuries has evolved over the past decade to reflect more effort to conserve function of the spleen.
 Records of 169 patients admitted over a 6-year period were identified as documenting the treatment of splenic injuries.
 We collected data regarding patient age, gender, degree of hemodynamic stability, number of units of blood required, severity of splenic injury, Injury Severity Score, and results of treatment.
 There were 143 adults (age greater than 16 years) and 26 pediatric patients (age less than 17 years), with mean age in the 2 groups of 31.6 and 11.4 years, respectively.
 Males comprised 72% of the group, and blunt injury occurred in 154 of the 169 patients.
 In the adults, splenectomy, splenorrhaphy, laparotomy without operative treatment of the spleen, and nonoperative management were observed 48%, 30%, 14%, and 8% of the time and in the pediatric group 31%, 27%, 19%, and 23% of the time, respectively.
 By using operative splenic repair techniques and increased use of nonoperative management, the splenic salvage rate has increased in the last 6 years from 41% to 61% without an increase in morbidity and mortality.
 Incidence of spleen salvage correlated with severity of spleen and overall injury and cardiovascular stability.
