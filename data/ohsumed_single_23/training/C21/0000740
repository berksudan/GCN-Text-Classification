Femoral neck fracture fixation. Comparison of a sliding screw with lag screws.
 The rigidity of a sliding compression screw and three cannulated lag screws in the treatment of subcapital fractures was compared in five pairs of female cadaver femora.
 There were no significant differences between the compressive strength, bone density, cortical thickness or Singh index of the bones in each pair.
 A subcapital fracture was standardised using a perpendicular saw cut across the femoral neck.
 A uniaxial 'load test system' with force and length measurement facilities was used to mimic cyclical stressing applied in vivo at a frequency of 0.5 Hz from 0 to 3 times body-weight.
 There was no significant difference between the fixation afforded by the sliding compression screw and three lag screws.
 Bone quality was the single most important factor in the stability of the bone implant unit.
