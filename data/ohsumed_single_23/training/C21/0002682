Late versus early onset problem drinking in older men.
 Age at onset of problem drinking was studied in 132 older men (age 60 years and older) admitted to a VA geriatric alcoholism outpatient treatment program.
 Demographics, alcohol history, self reported psychological status, special treatment, and treatment compliance variables were tested for association with onset age.
 Late onset (defined as onset of the first alcohol problem at or after age 60) was not uncommon, occurring in 15% of the sample (29% of patients age 65 or older).
 Compared to earlier onset cases, late onset alcohol problems were milder and more circumscribed, and were associated with less family alcoholism and greater psychological stability.
 Late onset patients were also more compliant with outpatient treatment requirements; however, treatment program variables were better predictors of compliance than onset age.
