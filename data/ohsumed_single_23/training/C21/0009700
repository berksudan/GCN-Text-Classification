Tardive dyskinesia: managing a common neuroleptic side effect.
 Neuroleptics are useful medications for the treatment of psychosis and severe behavioral disturbances in the elderly.
 Unfortunately, older patients are at a high risk of developing deleterious side effects from these medications, especially persistent tardive dyskinesia (TD).
 Diagnosis, risk factors, and cause and treatment of TD are discussed.
 It is important to do a careful assessment as to the indications for neuroleptic use, monitor closely for the development of TD and other side effects, and work closely with the patient and family in making decisions about neuroleptic use.
