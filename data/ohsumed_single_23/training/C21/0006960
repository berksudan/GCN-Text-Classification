A new orthosis for central cord syndrome and brachial plexus injuries.
 Proximal upper extremity weakness may develop secondary to central cord syndrome due to spinal cord injury or brachial plexus injury.
 Functional deficits, pain, decreased upper extremity arm swing during gait, and shoulder subluxation are common sequelae of these injuries.
 This report describes a new orthotic design that can be easily fabricated in two to four hours from readily available materials to compensate for these deficits.
 This orthosis allows for early participation in activities of daily living for patients with greater proximal than distal upper extremity weakness.
 The orthosis consists of a figure-eight shoulder harness and unilateral or bilateral forearm cuffs of orthoplast connected to the harness by flexible rubber tubing.
 The length of the tubing is adjustable through clamps connected to the forearm cuff to allow for variable arm positioning.
 Three patients, aged 14, 64, and 68, two with central cord syndrome and one with injury to the upper portion of the brachial plexus (Erb palsy) are described.
 Shoulder girdle musculature was less than 2, biceps less than 2, triceps less than 4, and hands less than 5 in all patients.
 Benefits from use of this orthosis may include improved arm swing and balance during ambulation, reduced shoulder pain and subluxation, and increased independence for tasks such as carrying lightweight objects, lower extremity dressing, bathing, light homemaking, and leisure activities such as gardening.
