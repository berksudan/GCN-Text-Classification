Liberty and tardive dyskinesia: informed consent to antipsychotic medication in the forensic psychiatric hospital.
 This paper addresses informed consent to antipsychotic medication of those incarcerated in a forensic psychiatric hospital.
 The ways in which the unique setting of the forensic psychiatric hospital impinge upon the three components of informed consent--information, voluntariness, and competency--are explored.
 Special attention is given to the risk-benefit ratio of receiving antipsychotic medication in terms of the liberty interests at stake--freedom of movement, that is, the effects of tardive dyskinesia, and freedom of space, that is, release from the forensic psychiatric facility.
