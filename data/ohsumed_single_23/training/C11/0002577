Histopathologic study of the Molteno glaucoma implant in three patients.
 Three eyes with the Molteno glaucoma implant (one eye with epithelial downgrowth, one eye with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome, and one eye with aphakia and glaucoma) were enucleated two to six years after implantation.
 Histopathologic examinations disclosed no evidence of erosion of sclera or conjunctiva of the eye by the glaucoma implant device.
 In the outer layers of the bleb wall, few and mostly degenerated inflammatory cells were present, which represented a minimal inflammatory reaction.
 Scanning electron microscopy of the tubes in these three patients showed that the tube was intact, patent, and without signs of degradation.
 The tube entering into the anterior chamber caused no appreciable inflammation and maintained its patency even when downgrowth epithelial cells lined the anterior chamber.
 The Molteno plate induced little or no inflammatory reaction.
 Therefore, the Molteno glaucoma implant is a useful device for patients with high risk for failure after surgery for glaucoma.
