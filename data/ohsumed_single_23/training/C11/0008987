Use of a symblepharon ring for treatment of over-filtration and leaking blebs after glaucoma filtration surgery.
 We report the use of a symblepharon ring in the treatment of seven cases of flat anterior chamber (six cases of total iridocorneal touch, and one of corneallens touch) secondary to overfiltration or to bleb leak.
 In all cases, the anterior chamber reformed within 24 hours after the symblepharon ring was used.
 Advantages of using the ring are: (a) it permits testing of visual acuity, tonometry, and intraocular examination without removing it; (b) it does not require suturing to the conjunctiva; (c) it does not disturb the corneal epithelium; (d) it may be available at institutions lacking other shells; and (e) it is cost-effective.
