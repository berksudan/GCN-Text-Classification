Effect of local anesthesia and ocular massage on central corneal curvature.
 Using a standard Javal keratometer, we obtained central corneal curvature measurements in 19 patients before and after the administration of local anesthesia.
 We noted flattening of mean average keratometry which approached statistical significance, along with an increase in overall astigmatism.
 Decreased intraocular pressure was not found to be a factor.
