Possible significance of cilioretinal arteries in low-tension glaucoma.
 Cilioretinal arteries arise from the short posterior ciliary artery circulation or directly from the choroidal circulation.
 The presence of a cilioretinal artery may in compromised discs steal flow from the peripapillary circulation and account for worsening glaucoma damage.
 We reviewed the records of 33 patients with unilateral cilioretinal arteries admitted for investigation of low-tension glaucoma.
 We looked for absolute difference between the affected and unaffected eyes as well as percent difference relative to the mean value for the two eyes and to the value for the unaffected eye in the following variables: mean defect, corrected loss variance or corrected pattern standard deviation, and adjusted neuroretinal rim area.
 No statistically significant differences were found.
 The mean disc area for the eyes with cilioretinal arteries was significantly larger than that previously reported for normal eyes.
 The results suggest that if vascular steal exists because of the presence of this artery, it is not of major clinical importance.
