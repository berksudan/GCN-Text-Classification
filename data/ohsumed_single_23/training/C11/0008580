Immunohistologic study of epiretinal membranes in proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
 We performed an immunohistologic study on 11 specimens of epiretinal membranes surgically obtained from patients who had rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
 Immunostaining procedures were used to identify immunoglobulin and complement deposits, to visualize class II antigen expression by proliferating cells, and to determine eventual infiltration by cells of the immune system.
 Diffuse deposits of IgG, IgA, IgE, C1q, C3c, and C3d were found in epiretinal membranes, whereas numerous cells, including glial or pigmented epithelial cells, expressed HLA-DR and HLA-DQ antigens.
 Some macrophages and B or T8 lymphocytes were identified.
 These results suggest activation of the immune system during the course of proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
 Class II antigen expression could be dependent upon growth-promoting factors and interferon gamma and could play a crucial role in this immune reaction, which resulted in immunoglobulin deposition and activation of complement.
 However, the eventual role of immune phenomena in the extension of proliferative processes remains to be determined.
