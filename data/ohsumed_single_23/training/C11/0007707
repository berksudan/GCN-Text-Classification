Serous retinal detachment following glaucoma filtering surgery.
 We report the occurrence of serous retinal detachment in association with choroidal effusion and hypotony in six eyes that had undergone glaucoma filtering surgery.
 Hypotony with choroidal effusion was documented in five patients before the onset of serous retinal detachment.
 While one patient underwent vitrectomy, treatment was conservative in the other patients.
 Serous retinal detachment and choroidal effusions resolved spontaneously as the intraocular pressure normalized.
 Although one patient regained preoperative visual acuity, all other patients lost at least one line of Snellen acuity.
