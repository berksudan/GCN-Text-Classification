Lateral wall advancement in orbital decompression.
 Treatment of dysthyroid orbitopathy can be enhanced with a modified craniofacial approach using a lateral wall osteotomy, and anterolateral advancement and osteosynthesis in conjunction with medial and inferior wall orbital decompression.
 The technique of lateral wall advancement is described, and the results are discussed.
 While the authors advocate orbital decompression for dysthyroid optic neuropathy, advancement of the lateral orbital wall can easily be performed as an adjunct to the two- or three-wall decompression procedure.
 Advancement appears to increase the overall decompressive effect by providing a potential space where lateral expansion can occur and by enlarging the bony orbital volume.
 It also appears to lessen lid retraction and facilitates (and in some cases, obviates) the need for further lid retraction surgery.
