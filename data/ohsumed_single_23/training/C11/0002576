Magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of vitreoretinal disease in eyes with intraocular silicone oil.
 Media opacification in eyes filled with silicone oil makes the evaluation of recurrent retinal detachment difficult.
 Ultrasonography through silicone oil is subject to significant imaging artifacts.
 We performed magnetic resonance imaging on six patients with unilateral intravitreal silicone oil to determine if the technique would detect detached retina and subretinal oil.
 All patients had undergone pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil injection for proliferative vitreoretinopathy; five patients had encircling solid silicone scleral buckles.
 In five patients the media were clear, and ophthalmoscopic findings were correlated with magnetic resonance findings.
 Four patients had recurrence of inferior retinal detachment; magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated subretinal oil in three of these patients.
 One patient had a concentric, shallow, anterior retinal detachment; magnetic resonance scanning demonstrated a globular hyperintensity suggestive of subretinal oil.
 In the sixth patient, who had an opaque cornea, magnetic resonance imaging suggested that the retina was attached preoperatively; this was confirmed at subsequent surgery.
 A chemical shift artifact was helpful in defining the contour of retinal detachments and the presence of subretinal oil by outlining the silicone oil within the eye.
