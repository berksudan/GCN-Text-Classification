Caspar Stromayr: sixteenth century ophthalmologist.
 Caspar Stromayr, ophthalmologist and hernia surgeon, is credited with writing the first German ophthalmic work of known authorship.
 Written in about 1559 as an appendix to Practica Copiosa, a larger work on hernia surgery, the ophthalmic chapters describe Stromayr's thoughts on the etiology and treatment of cataract.
 Stromayr, a master craftsman, also expresses his hostility to the shams and ignorance of the charlatan eye surgeons of his day.
 This interesting historical article provides a biographical sketch of Stromayr, a description of his book, and a translation of two chapters, "On Cataract of the Eye: How They Take Their Beginning and Whence they Come" and "How You Recognize the Cataract, When It is Ripe to Recline or to be Taken Away.".
