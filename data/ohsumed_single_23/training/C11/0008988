Hemihang-back recession: description of the technique and review of the literature.
 We describe a modification of the hang-back and loop techniques that we call the hemihang-back recession, in which the muscle is reattached to the sclera posterior to the original insertion with a single, absorbable suture.
 We recommend it for difficult strabismus cases, specifically when recessions of 7 mm or more are required.
