Posterior horizontal and vertical tightening to treat combined punctal ectropion with medial canthal tendon laxity.
 The classical operations to treat either medial canthal tendon laxity or punctal aversion occurring alone possess drawbacks if they are used to treat these conditions when they occur simultaneously.
 A simplified procedure is described whereby tissue is removed via a posterior eyelid approach so that the eyelid may be tightened both horizontally and vertically, thus inverting the punctum and fixating it in the lacrimal lake.
 This procedure is quite easy to perform and can be done under local anesthesia in the office.
