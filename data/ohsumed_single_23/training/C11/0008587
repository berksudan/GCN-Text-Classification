Topical use of cyclosporine in the treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis.
 We treated 11 patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis for four to nine months with topical cyclosporine as a 2% dilution in castor oil.
 No significant side effects occurred, except for mild and transient burning upon administration.
 Within the first 15 days, both symptoms and signs of the condition improved significantly, and these results were maintained throughout the entire treatment.
 Relapses of the disease occurred two to four months after the end of the therapy.
 A double-masked clinical trial of nine patients (2% cyclosporine in castor oil vs castor oil alone) confirmed the results.
 Treated eyes improved significantly for both signs and symptoms as compared to control eyes.
 Topical cyclosporine may, therefore, be considered an effective substitute for corticosteroids, with an excellent anti-inflammatory activity in patients with both corticosteroid-dependent and corticosteroid-resistant vernal keratoconjunctivitis.
