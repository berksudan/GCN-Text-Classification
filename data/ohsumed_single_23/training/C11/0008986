Glaucoma secondary to epithelial downgrowth and 5-fluorouracil.
 Since epithelial downgrowth involves an actively proliferating intraocular tissue, it is possible that the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil may inhibit it.
 We report a case of secondary glaucoma caused by epithelial downgrowth in which filtration surgery was performed with adjunctive use of subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil.
 On cessation of the injections, the retrocorneal membrane grew rapidly to involve the entire posterior cornea.
 The eye eventually became blind and painful and was enucleated.
 The use of 5-fluorouracil given in the usual manner appears to have been a failure.
