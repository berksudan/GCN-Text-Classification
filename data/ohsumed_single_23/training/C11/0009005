A new ophthalmic microtrephine.
 We present a new instrument designed to facilitate the microtrephination of tissues required in various ophthalmic procedures.
 This microtrephine is a 21-gauge stainless steel tube, 0.81 mm in diameter and 16 mm long, with a sharpened cutting end and a plastic finger-grip area to facilitate micro-rotation.
 A standard plastic luer hub allows the trephine to be used with a syringe, either a standard type or one with a spring-assisted plunger.
 Scar tissue, biopsy specimens, or abnormal inflammatory fluids can be suctioned into the syringe for subsequent pathologic examination.
