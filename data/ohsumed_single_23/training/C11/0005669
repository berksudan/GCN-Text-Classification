Assessing acquired ocular diseases.
 When assessing a patient's ocular complaint, one must listen carefully to the description of the symptoms.
 A decrease in vision is most frequently the symptom that prompts a person to seek attention.
 Pain in and around the eye is the next most frequent symptom complained about.
 Discomfort is often tolerated for long periods before professional attention is obtained.
 Visual acuity must be checked, for this is the vital sign by which exacerbation or improvement of many conditions is measured.
 We all take our eyes for granted until we suddenly cannot see, then the world takes on a completely different complexity, for loss of vision may mean loss of livelihood and independence.
