Unusual exudative retinal detachment 9 months after scleral buckling surgery.
 A 49-year-old man developed exudative retinal detachment 9 months after uncomplicated scleral buckling surgery in the left eye.
 The subretinal exudates were strictly localized along the buckle and showed remarkable response to steroid.
 The cause would be noninfectious inflammation like posterior scleritis, triggered by the buckle itself or its associated factors.
 It is important to note that subretinal exudates long after scleral buckling can occur in consequence of steroid-responsive inflammation as well as insidious bacterial or fungal infection described previously.
